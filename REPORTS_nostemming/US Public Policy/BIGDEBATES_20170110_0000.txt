our view 
market view 
view the risks increased protectionism meaningful 
markets have taken more sanguine view that policy makers will not initiate 
protectionist measures 
the recent shift political rhetoric the along with the rise political parties with 
more protectionist bent has signaled deeper rift over the benefits trade 
liberalisation while markets have taken more sanguine view this issue believe 
the risk potential trade policy occurring meaningful expect trade policies 
take predominantly the form either border adjustability delivered part tax 
reform package via the imposition tariffs 
one the main goals behind the policy change generate growth alpha under the 
backdrop persistently mild growth trends primarily through improvement the 
us net trade position more supportive trade policy could promote export growth 
well creating more domestic employment opportunities expect the potential 
policy actions either through border tax adjustment presented part 
wider tax reform package increase import tariffs 
potential impact growth 
under more protectionist regime there potential for near term upside growth 
driven entirely narrowing the trade balance however this would come cost 
permanent output loss the also unlikely kick manufacturing any 
reasonable time frame meet its own demand the industry has already undergone 
decades long shrinkage while other countries have built significant competitive 
advantage over time 
potential impact asia 
these potential policy changes are aimed improving the trade position the 
goods trade balance currently deficit gdp asia will 
main focus given that the region currently accounts for the goods trade 
deficit within the region china korea and japan will likely the most impacted under 
trade policy change given the size the deficits that the has relative these 
countries any adverse trade policy actions even targeted one few countries 
asia will reverberate through the region due the high intensity intraregional trade 
sector wise telecommunications equipment computers related automatic data 
processing parts and passenger cars are sectors that will relatively exposed 
changes trade policy 
how would asian policymakers react 
should the implement trade related policy changes asian policy makers could seek 
file complaints against the under the wto dispute settlement mechanism 
restrict corporates conduct business with the and deny exports key 
components and launch counter investigations and probes into selected sectors 
alleviate the growth headwinds from weaker exports growth policymakers the region 
may rely fiscal policy boost domestic demand and increase export incentive 
schemes 
within the region there intense focus the china relationship considering the 
close trade linkages that have expanded rapidly terms overall trade goods and 
services china the united states second largest source imports after the 
european union and the fourth largest export market after the canada and 
mexico meanwhile china accounts for over two thirds the goods and services 
trade balance dwarfing the deficit with other trading partners 
the initiates trade protectionist measures against china expect china real gdp 
growth slow and under the and tariff scenarios respectively 
while tariff could result drag growth terms policy actions 
china could choose respond via asymmetric trade war selectively raising 
tariffs against the employ measures such restricting the purchase goods 
and services the imposes tariff the event tariff 
china may retaliate imposing the same rate goods imports across these three 
scenarios would see long term output loss despite short term upside growth

our view 
market view 
tax reform stimulus coming but its impact may fall short 
expectations the good news for investors and the economy that congress 
tax reform will boon for risk assets soon credit and equity 
has the motive and opportunity execute tax reform that our 
reform like autos and retail hints its potential disappoint those 
view effectively fiscal stimulus the bad news that this stimulus may 
expecting policy changes unambiguously positive the near term the 
lack punch given the likelihood resulting fed hawkishness and potential 
latter exemplified the roughly bps rise treasury rates and 
corporate finance disruptions 
near gains the since the election 
underperformance sectors most negatively impacted potential tax 
while details remain scant see meaningful risk disruptive changes 
like interest deductibility curbs and border adjustability the latter 
particular would represent sea change corporate finance that the near 
term risks limiting profitability and boosting usd and tightening financial 
conditions 
corporate tax faqs 
scant and perhaps even unreliable information may have outsized influence markets 
progress toward reform that spirit flesh out our base case for reform and 
offer some subjective assessments key aspects tax policy think this will help 
investors navigate tax sensitive markets where the near term fundamentals may 
subordinated sentiment and valuation 
why will tax reform happen reasons motive and opportunity the former with 
republican controlled senate and house president elect trump has legislative partners 
with very similar tax reform blueprints speaker paul ryan strategic imperative 
recent years has been tax reform statements the principal decision makers about the 
legislative agenda affirm that this will priority 
how will tax reform happen although republicans are demonstrating unity the 
moment the tax debate makes plain new division the party which key 
understanding how tax reform will come together the fiscal hawks the house 
representatives have reiterated that all tax reform must revenue neutral the 
facto keynesians the trump orbit are willing prioritize growth plans over shortterm deficit concerns need given that both groups want see tax reform done 
the how becomes exercise adjusting rules and procedures way that would 
satisfy the somewhat conflicting goals both groups think this drives few key 
conclusions 
comprehensive approach the high costs corporate tax reform plus the 
individual treatment some business income means that there are more options 
achieve technically revenue neutral bill addressing corporate and individual 
tax reform together 
trade offs house hawks trump keynesians currently outlined the 
congressional budget modelers are unlikely score the house gop blueprint 
revenue neutral therefore something has give either risk the bill political 
viability closing more tax expenditures the likely preference house deficit 
hawks congress would have authorize higher deficit perhaps the 
preference the trump team given its growth deal making orientation 
the accidental stimulus could disappoint even the fiscal hawks get what they 
want dynamically scored revenue neutral tax reform still likely net 
fiscal stimulus static basis however such plan comes with the realpolitik 
need meaningfully change some tax preference items even those changes are 
softened phase outs limitations and grandfathering hence the positives 
stimulus could mitigated disruption from changes like interest deduction caps 
and border adjustability which could the near term adversely impact corporate 
profitability 
which disruptive changes are possible industry specific preferences would most 
risk pro growth and dynamic scoring friendly preferences would like embraced 
interest deductibility limitations are play attractive revenue offset while not part 
our base case think border adjustability has higher chance being included 
than the consensus appears assume 
who would most impacted border adjustability the house republican 
blueprint proposes convert the corporate income tax into destination based cash 
flow taxation system that would border adjust not taxing revenues from exports 
and disallowing deductions for the cost imports theorized that the policy trade 
neutral the dollar should appreciate offset the border adjustment 
credit exports and corresponding disallowance for imports absent full foreign 
exchange offset border adjustability will benefit net exporters and hinder net importers 
discussed the currency section below industries with high net important content 
such apparel and consumer electronics retailers would face headwind from the 
border adjustment industries that are net exporters such agriculture energy and 
materials would benefit from the proposed border adjustment media and technology 
companies that can license high value intellectual property international customers 
also stand benefit the long run 
how will reform impact the reported corporate tax rates estimate reported 
effective tax rates would dip from aggregate reform scenario 
that does not include border adjustability this shift would result increase 
reported after tax profits potential curbing interest deductibility foreign tax 
exposure mid and state local taxes effectively would set floor the low 
for aggregate reported tax rates even the federal rate reduced 
will lawmakers settle territorial worldwide system 
with republican control the three branches government our base case that the 
united states transitions towards territorial style international taxation system 
however president elect trump campaigned worldwide taxation system with 
minimum rate while they are structurally different approaches the outcomes may 
similar for many multinationals 
today corporations are generally subject tax their worldwide income 
however income earned foreign subsidiaries normally taxed only when profits are 
repatriated back the parent structure commonly referred deferral this 
deferral mechanism creates incentives for firms reinvest and keep foreign generated 
profits abroad temporarily permanently avoid the incidence taxation 
resulting the trapped earnings phenomenon among many multinationals 
pure territorial system income earned foreign jurisdiction would not subject 
tax the united states many investors believe this will the outcome 
republican controlled tax reform however believe pure territorial system likely 
only destination based cash flow system scenario 
the committee ways and means tax reform blueprint proposes structure called 
exemption system where earnings from foreign subsidiaries companies would 
exempted from taxation this system actually fits within worldwide taxation 
system but effectively converts into modern territorial system however 
maintaining overarching worldwide system provides policy flexibility prevent abuse 
and base erosion for instance the republican sponsored tax reform act 
included similar exemption system but would also implement effective minimum 
tax for income derived from intangibles and intellectual property believe 
destination based cash flow system with border adjustability isn component final 
policy then exemption based territorial system will need include similar 
components prevent tax base erosion thus the outcome may similar 
minimum tax rate regime especially for multinationals deriving income from 
intangibles and intellectual property sources 
transition and repatriation all policy options seek end today deferral system 
transition policy required for current deferred and untaxed accumulated foreign 
earnings the house blueprint proposes mandatory effective rate for cashbacked accumulated earnings and president elect trump campaign proposed 
mandatory tax accumulated foreign earnings for more discussion transition and 
repatriation policy please see accounting valuation focus repatriation top 
investor questions nov 
what the timing for tax reform although anytime possible comprehensive 
reform passing our base case which assumes the gop sticks its plan repeal 
the affordable care act first appears that the republicans will prioritize repealing the 
aca ahead tax reform not foresee republicans getting easily senate 
votes either tax reform aca repeal barring full repeal the filibuster which possible but not our base case senate republicans would have advance 
both the aca repeal and tax reform via the reconciliation process rules permit only one 
reconciliation bill for each revenues spending and debt limit practice think 
this gives congress the opportunity move one major spending legislation for each 
annual budget resolution repealing the aca the top priority that suggests 
congress would act the repeal early provided that congress sticks its april 
budget resolution deadline once done with that reconciliation congress could then 
pursue early budget resolution for the next fiscal year handle comprehensive 
tax reform 
what could delay tax reform the biggest risk our view that deficit hawks the 
republican caucus would become emboldened perhaps their overlapping concerns 
with the nature the aca repeal and push dogmatic view the impact tax 
reform the deficit this could limit the flexibility the proposal which may 
required satisfy competing demands for the bill within the republican party 
will there phase ins and grandfathering historical precedent suggests the answer 
yes 
the name the game broaden the base and lower the rate broadening the base 
requires certain taxpayers give their favorable tax preferences for the common 
good however breaking hard and often demands transition the last major tax 
overhaul the tax reform act contained over special transitions rules 
many them industry and even firm specific transition relief was granted for changes 
accelerated depreciation the investment tax credit rehabilitation credits the 
minimum tax net operating losses specific accounting rules municipal bonds pensions 
and insurance indeed historical records credit these special transition relief rules 
crucial passing the legislation 
the current code more complex and the objectives are arguably more difficult 
achieve than even the reform believe special transition rules perhaps even 
targeted specific firms will common and consequential they were then 
the main question transition receive regards interest deductibility 
immediate restriction interest deductibility strikes many investors untenable 
investors have also highlighted capital market concerns even deductibility limited 
only new debt share these concerns and believe policy makers will provide 
transition relief order prevent market disfunction however while transition rules 
will required believe this creates increased complexity meeting budgetary goals 
and for implementing key features such proposed the border adjustability

our view 
market view 
believe the market too sanguine about the possibility border 
adjustment being included final package recent news suggests house 
likely that the market pricing very low probability that border 
adjustment passed the market has paid little attention the provision 
republicans and president elect trump are coming together around the plan 
until very recently and the usd moves since the election have largely been 
while not part our base case think border adjustability has higher 
consistent both magnitude and timing with the expected reaction higher 
chance being included than the consensus 
interest rates and the expectations for fiscal stimulus 
believe border adjustment would not result full exchange rate offset 
don expect usd appreciation decades research shows 
many including proponents the plan believe there will immediate 
that exchange rates have had long deviations from their fair value according 
one time appreciation usd which would offset the effects the 
provision trade they argue that the textbook model exchange rate 
simple textbook model instead think rise usd 
adjustment will accurate this case and the market will efficiently price 
reasonable 
such change and trade flows would unaffected 
the proposed border adjustment mechanism would have materially 
negative impact companies which are large net importers such 
retailers and help boost net exporters agriculture 
the house republican blueprint proposes convert the corporate income tax into 
destination based cash flow taxation system that would border adjust not taxing 
revenues from exports and disallowing deductions for the cost imports the economic 
effects such policy are similar export subsidy combined with import tariff 
equal size theorized that the policy trade neutral the dollar should 
appreciate offset the border adjustment credit exports and 
corresponding disallowance for imports absent full foreign exchange offset border 
adjustability will benefit net exporters and hinder net importers 
however any significant usd appreciation will also pressure translated revenue and 
earnings from foreign subsidiaries companies the proposed mechanism for the 
border adjustment will also introduce foreign exchange volatility the reported 
effective tax rate believe broad business opposition and trade law concerns pose 
formidable resistance achieving legislation 
believe the market too sanguine about the possibility border adjustment being 
passed the policy facing significant political pushback but recent news suggests 
house republicans and the president elect are coming together around the plan and are 
serious about getting passed while not part our base case think border 
adjustability has higher chance being included than the consensus appears 
assuming meanwhile the market pricing very low probability usd has 
significantly rallied since the election but has been broadly line with the 
fundamentals higher interest rate differentials see exhibit border adjustability has 
only really been topic for investors the last few weeks during which time usd has 
been roughly unchanged 
exhibit usd has largely moved with rate differentials since election not expectation border 
adjustment 
source macrobond federal reserve bloomberg morgan stanley research 
believe border adjustment would not result full exchange rate offset many 
including proponents the plan believe that border adjustment enacted there will 
immediate one time appreciation usd which would offset the effects the 
provision trade examples the textbook theory behind this essentially 
purchasing power parity ppp that exchange rates full adjust change 
import export competitiveness however decades research shows that exchange 
rates has long deviations from their fair value under ppp and these deviations can take 
many years decay all our view this makes extremely doubtful that the 
exchange rate offset would immediate the full size the textbook says 
instead think rise usd reasonable even don get full 
exchange rate offset the policy will still have large impact competitiveness and 
therefore usd would expect markets internalize these policies some level 
worries around the wto ruling against the plan could limit some appreciation and inject 
further uncertainty beyond the question whether passed expect usd 
appreciation relatively broad based though there are some notable exceptions 
think the pboc would allow cny depreciation but not much other competitors 
while possibly increasing capital controls stem capital flight 
second order impacts significant but difficult predict significant appreciation 
usd could cause risk off period and turmoil emerging markets which would suggest 
outperformance relative this scenario however the size and persistence 
such shock for debate the fed would also face challenge the one hand 
border adjustment would lead much higher inflation the first year and 
accompanied with broader tax reform which should boost the economy this would 
imply more hawkish fed however the fed may just see the inflation transitory and 
worried about the disruptive effect much stronger usd the domestic 
economy and global markets calling for dovish response 
furthermore depending the ruling the wto retaliatory action could become 
likely from large trading partners the end the day given all these factors very 
difficult predict the second order impacts unprecedented policy action

our view 
market view 
believe that there real potential for more activist situations 
recent investor meetings have heavily focused the potential for activism 
return the sector spurred media reports that trian building stake 
while the record activism indeed mixed over longer time frame the 
major performance differentiator that activism works best supportive 
macro environment are emerging from this shallow industrial 
recession history suggests that the combination elevated sector multiples 
honeywell however investors are unsure whether activism real 
positive for sector performance given mixed track record generally find 
that the market skeptical activist involvement but stocks tend 
outperform where stake revealed 
and lower tax rates could hypothetically attract the interest activist 
investors multi industry we developed framework screen our 
universe identify relatively inexpensive underperforming stocks with diverse 
portfolios strong balance sheets and persistent eps underperformance 
recent investor meetings have seen notable pick interest around the topic 
activism note that activist fund trian that has been heavily involved the multiindustry sector and pnr has disclosed that building stake its next 
target press reports including bloomberg december link have suggested that 
could honeywell trian has cited its policy not commenting market rumors and 
honeywell has not issued statement while have knowledge any pending 
transactions any activist investors interests and have intention linger the 
topic which companies are activists radar are interested whether activism 
has added value and whether the conditions are place for return more activism 
multi industry 
first let have look notable recent examples activism multi industry 
took look back performance stocks within our universe that have been targets 
from notable activists relational and trian have historically been most active the 
space well known for targeting industrial companies break opportunities and 
advocating for more efficient balance sheets briefly summarize the five examples 
from our coverage follows 
trian ingersoll rand filing may trian announced stake 
seeking opportunity improve profitability and enhance shareholder value through 
cost cutting improving key metrics and exploring strategic alternatives trian had 
almost immediate impact leading strategic review the portfolio that culminated 
tax free spin off the combined commercial and residential security business 
shareholders the board also abandoned its ambition improve its investment grade 
debt rating setting leverage target ebitda and announcing billion share 
repurchase program trian stake was the most profitable our analysis 
outperforming peers the three years post announcement 
trian pentair effort urge management pursue more trian fund 
management took stake pnr believing that could create value 
facilitating prudent industry consolidation trian laid out its thesis filing june 
but did not submit detailed analysis since the investment pnr announced 
september that would recommend cio garden trian seat the 
board which still holds however since the investment the stock has severely 
underperformed peers across all time periods down today price from initial 
stake largely due sharp reduction earnings power caused the deterioration 
and subsequent sale its valves controls segment 
trian general electric trian most recent and largest industrial investment 
announced october when the firm disclosed billion stake trian 
detailed slide deck outlining its investment thesis was released parallel with the 
announcement that was broadly supportive management ongoing strategy 
divesting the bulk its financial assets trian argued that were adopt higher 
leverage levels earnings power could surpass target with the stock 
potentially appreciating the level 
relational illinois tool works the second most successful activist situation 
relational investment itw with the stock outperforming since relational 
announced its investment january part the stake relational was 
granted option have board seat including nomination the following year 
what made this investment particular success was that culminated itw agreeing 
divest its lower margin business units decorative surfaces and industrial packaging 
pursue aggressive cost reduction measures and step stock repurchase while 
increasing balance sheet leverage 
relational spx corp relational investment spx corp began february 
reporting stake the core thesis was encourage the company sell off 
assets order redefine its portfolio centered around its higher multiple flow control 
assets however the busting the oil gas capex bubble led sharp drop 
earnings power and multiple rating making this the least successful activist story 
multi industry 
the table below shows the activist situations have aggregate resulted modest 
outperformance the group particularly the first month with two caveats the 
outperformance tends fade over the long term there extremely wide 
dispersion returns with spread between the top and bottom spxc

our view 
market view 
trump likely further challenge drug pricing but republican support 
regulation questionable expect president elect trump further scrutinize 
the biopharma industry vulnerable ongoing price criticism and 
scrutiny this because many drug companies may continue raise 
drug prices and industry participants potentially using social media blame and 
list prices the double digit percentage range annually offset rising 
shame specific drug companies they opt take abnormally high price increases 
rebates and deliver positive net pricing and because biotech drug list 
may also propose constrain pricing via direct medicare negotiations other 
pricing often over per year 
mechanisms but republicans are generally not advocates driving drug prices 
down and such proposal will require changes part which may hard given 
the success the program 
list pricing action has been aggressive but realized net pricing more 
modest many pharma companies and some biotech companies have 
been raising list prices the double digit range annually order drive 
the new normal gross price increases could settle high single digits below 
past three years this view supported commentary from select 
single digit net price inflation the face growing rebates discounts 
group biopharma ceos committing moderating inflation allergan novo 
prices rose 
ims indicated that list prices rose average but net 
sen mccain proposal scrutinize increases above note drug 
climate around inflation was more subdued the catch for biopharma that 
consumers are exposed when they have not met deductibles lack 
coverage consumers have become increasingly frustrated about 
companies may realize lower annual net price increases they moderate list price 
high out pocket costs for drugs due insurance coverage designs 
companies already committed pay pbms rebates june when the 
inflation expect some companies try avoid public shaming issuing 
smaller but more frequent price increases rather than mid high single digits two 
times per year but this may not insulate against from scrutiny 
republican led congress would likely not pass legislation control 
drug prices most republicans are generally viewed free market 
advocates and the republican party has historically worked against 
commercial market forces will squeeze net prices irrespective trump 
democratic attempts have the government manage drug prices 
payers pbms are tightening the screws major categories such diabetes and 
autoimmune disease expect plans pressure net prices more drug 
categories biosimilars will enable pbms tighten formulary access further 
trump reimportation comments appear have been overblown the 
market believe reimportation highly unlikely adopted for two reasons 
fda unlikely able ensure the legitimacy safety imported drugs and 
other countries would likely outlaw exporting drugs the the 
approved reimportation prevent runs product and price hikes their own 
countries 
the ultimate solution the drug pricing conundrum tbd unclear 
how when the industry could transition system which involves lower rate 
list price inflation plus lower rate annual rebate growth manufacturers strive 
realize positive growth yoy net pricing but payers pbms want drive yoy

specialized chips for what called artificial intelligence inference 
real time usage neural networks will emerge see graphics from 
nvidia and somewhat more surprisingly field programmable gate arrays 
fpgas from xilinx emerging significant beneficiary inference the 
market bullish nvidia graphics solutions for inference and agree 
while don expect nvidia dominate inference they have training 
their large advantage software and infrastructure gives them strong 
starting position though arguably priced into the stock 
real time usage neural network databases that are created training 
largely been done intel processors the cloud elsewhere but those 
market mixed fpga role but sees intel altera the driver seat 
where see bigger role for xilinx altera with customer microsoft 
tasks become more complex see substantial use accelerators 
pioneered the use fpgas the data center and the acquisition intel 
algorithms where nvidia has established early dominance has thus far 
marries them with xeon processors which have data center share but 
inference going much more fragmented than training but should 
become large market years and will the central compute engine 
for important markets like the autonomous vehicle see seeds being 
planted for the use graphics and fpgas the coming year while 
small opportunity this year where early momentum will 
established see theoretical basis for fpgas being the best solution but 
the higher complexity fpgas leaves solid role for graphics well 
product delays put xilinx stronger product position than had expected 
all top cloud customers both companies need improve software which 
expect see 
market mixed intel role intel claims share artificial intelligence 
workloads primarily with microprocessors and has the broadest range 
solutions for accelerators with altera nervana and phi see 
spending net additive for intel but see threat its control from 
other ecosystems entering the playing field 
background how are semiconductors used artificial intelligence deep 
learning 
saw sharp migration towards and deep learning techniques for solving both 
new and traditional problems machine learning program exposed large amount 
data and trained learn about that data its own and recursively build that 
knowledge over time deep learning approach solving such problems 
developers build tightly interwoven database based loosely how human brain 
works called neural network this emerged the last couple years significant 
breakthrough solving many compute problems particularly with highly visual data 
the building the neural network database normally happens offline not real 
time environment this called training 
from semiconductor standpoint one the big surprises least and 
most investors spoken with was the rapid adoption graphics chips from 
nvidia for this training application training hugely computationally intensive and 
traditional linear microprocessors aren optimal for solving those types 
computations the world best microprocessors which are still the best solution the 
vast majority computing problems are limited when comes building neural nets 
recursively graphics chips are more efficient for that narrow application set and nvidia 
has been investing aggressively for decade believing this opportunity use cases 
exploded nvidia grew its data center business now revenues 
new use cases are emerging literally weekly move through the year and nvidia 
appears have the dominant training solution for least the next couple years 
exhibit nvidia data center business quarterly pace has increased over the last years 
source company data morgan stanley research 
once the neural network trained that network accessed real time sometimes 
the cloud sometimes device this called inference that being done 
almost entirely intel microprocessors but even intel expects broad range 
accelerators used computationally more sophisticated inference tasks come 
market will see the first use cases specialized inference hardware good 
lead indicator for the next years this certainly orders magnitude larger than the 
training opportunity unit terms albeit much lower price points but ultimately the 
best inference engine going many places including the heart the 
autonomous vehicle 
inference going remain highly fragmented there are high precision inference 
tasks and simpler inference tasks compared training there typically much less 
computational intensity but more focus low power and low latency since inference 
real time still very important market that could ultimate bigger than training 
and should establish the roadmap 
see several classes potential solutions this computation problem 
microprocessors generally lack the parallelism theoretically the most efficient 
inference engines but they have the practical advantage that they are already place incumbency matters for simpler inference tasks the cloud such movie 
recommendations utilizing neural net there simply isn enough computational 
complexity justify inserting another architecture into mix already dominated 
intel 
field programmable gate arrays are market today primarily used for 
communications and industrial infrastructure markets similar graphics building 
block not initially designed for these applications they are emerging theory the 
best solutions for many inference and other accelerator applications many recent 
academic papers showing the benefits fpgas over other chips for inference due 
their low latency lower power consumption graphics microprocessors and higher 
degree flexibility the challenge that fpgas are very difficult use properly 
optimally requiring circuit designers who aren usually employed cloud vendors 
departments think what has happen make this relevant going 
set abstraction layers that shield the user from that complexity while still 
allowing users benefit from the optimal parallel compute capabilities 
graphics chips from nvidia intel and amd with dominant role training 
nvidia has built significant leadership and software over the last decade recently 
launched its second generation inference solutions while graphics some ways 
suboptimal for inference applications due high precision data overkill for some use 
cases high power consumption and higher latency fpgas the ease use could 
long way and inference workloads increase complexity graphics could become 
optimal solution 
custom chips over time see most machine vision types chips moving 
neural network inference approach and there will many applications with wide 
range complexity both graphics chips and fpgas were originally designed for other 
functions and bring great deal unneeded overhead cost and power for the task 
there least theoretical basis that stripping away that overhead with dedicated 
inference chips going most efficient intel nervana acquisition aimed these 
opportunities are specialty chips from companies such ambarella google made

microsoft aggressively using altera fpgas accelerate search and last week saw 
aws offering xilinx fpgas for the use its enterprise customers see only small 
revenue ramp this year not earnings driver but would expect see 
enough evidence cloud traction get investors more excited 
further counter consensus see xilinx increasingly strong position get 
business sitting alongside intel microprocessors despite competitor altera alignment 
with data center leader intel discussions with customers indicate that delays altera 
and parts give xilinx solid performance lead intel altera copackaged 
part seems getting less traction pooled fpga approach and xilinx decisions 
have simpler bit dsp cores better suited inference applications xilinx has 
talked about this being opportunity for them driving about

conversations make think that they could hit that milestone year two earlier 
impact stocks 
nvidia line with consensus believe nvidia going the biggest 
semiconductor beneficiary machine learning its leadership training seems 
unassailable the intermediate term and the ease use and integration ensures them 
seat the table high end inference expect the stock continue work 
though gaming the bigger earnings driver see nvidia secular position data

amd see amd role inference somewhat limited least until vega boosts 
their graphical performance next year recent wins alibaba and google were related 
vdi not machine learning still the clear higher value graphics these 
opportunities certainly opens opportunities here but see those priced 
xilinx are warming the xilinx story this opportunity comes into view 
emphasize that revenue dollars for are going small early for this 
opportunity but the narrative here should strong the company has already press 
released relationships with baidu and aws and has traction with several other top 
cloud vendors and could even see traction within the leader fpga usage microsoft 
alterative altera some applications xilinx has meaningfully underperformed 
late industry consolidation has focused elsewhere 
intel see modest positive for intel earnings but negative for their strategic 
control over the data center many these spending projects are new and incremental 
existing spending the use case for unaccelerated cpus for inference theoretically 
unappealing but practically the path least resistance those microprocessors are 
already there far accelerators intel has the broadest array solutions with

most investors believe the inflection point for and still few years 
away return investment spend less transparent compared 
years ago however cios don yet list top priority suggesting low 
public cloud which was largely cost decision its early days the training 
level total spend see number factors that could drive more 
required for computers understand company and industry specific data 
positive spending trends first significant acquisition spend over the 
sets time consuming additionally the size and transparency the 
last year including microsoft acquisition linkedin ibm acquisitions 
financial impact the large providers limited for these reasons 
the weather company truven health and merge healthcare and 
inventors view longer term trend with minimal impact over the next 
salesforce com spend several smaller machine learning analytics 
year 
tuck acquisitions likely improve the value proposition platforms 
second increased consumer awareness through amazon echo apple 
investment plays are limited there are few any publicly traded pure 
siri and google home likely leak into business adoption much like the 
play machine learning and companies and the market tends gravitate 
consumer smartphone market drove enterprises adopt more mobile 
towards nvida covered joseph moore ytd while 
friendly approach lastly while was year investigation into use 
believing the impact larger technology companies limited 
cases see number large customer engagements moving forward 
for example just announced ibm watson will integrated into vehicles 
ibm early relationship with pfizer broadening additional use 
cases and amazon just introduced amazon grocery store without lines 
checkout counters that relies upon computer vision sensors and machine 
learning technology 
see platforms not applications winning with microsoft amazon 
ibm underappreciated leaders see value accruing cloud delivered 
platforms that allow for both off the shelf and customized solutions today 
microsoft amazon and ibm are the leading enterprise platforms each with 
market share the other hand see functionality standard 
across applications rather than area potential differentiation result 
see less value accruing companies like workday and adobe who are 
focused features within existing solutions 
the use cases for machine learning and artificial intelligence will only 
continue grow from here 
machine learning represent massive trillion tam artificial intelligence and 
machine learning platforms allow companies gain access the data that isn 
accessible today this data such pictures videos sensors heartbeats the ability 
pull this today onto one cloud platform and connect other data sets allows for 
new insights that remove inefficiency and open new revenue opportunities for 
businesses healthcare ibm breaking down the silo approach electronic medical 
records medical images every research paper journal ever published genomics data 
clinical trial data and much more result several years training ibm watson 
has made diagnoses where the medical system failed and can connect patients the 
drug trials most likely successful with higher efficiency than trained doctors but 
use cases expand well beyond healthcare industrial infrastructure maintenance 
transportation fleet management retail customized marketing inventory 
management and many other industries ibm sees market for making previously 
inaccessible data visible and the insights provides consumers and businesses nearly 
double the traditional market today 
data the holy grail over time expect algorithms become commoditized 
leaving data the value enhancer any cloud platform all three leaders today microsoft amazon ibm either already own large data sets amazon retail media usage 
data stepped data acquisitions the last year microsoft spend linkedin 
ibm spent the weather company plus healthcare data sets numerous

our view 
market view 
for the first time decade see credible long term investment case for 
steel equities while specificity and details the fiscal stimulus are still 
the market unsure the size and scope president elect trump 
infrastructure plan and protectionist trade policies 
scarce believe trump plans for infrastructure spending could early 
the queue since these proposals will need approval from congress any 
investors are unclear what trump infrastructure package would look like 
incremental steel demand will likely show the earliest 
and the overall size spending topic debate allocation money 
conservatively estimate trump stimulus plan could increase steel 
towards various types projects unclear since some infrastructure projects 
demand annually for years 
consume much more steel than others result infrastructure spending 
hasn been fully priced into stocks 
near term think that the trump administration will very supportive 
additional protectionist measures for the steel industry and circumvention 
the trade protection side the market believes that high anti dumping and 
duties will key priority trade action doesn require approval from 
countervailing duties have already been levied against several countries and 
congress and there high likelihood that trade barriers will increase higher 
the there only limited upside from trump supportive policies 
prices and lower imports will lead higher utilization rates mills and 
big tailwind for the industry think that aks and offer the most leverage 
trump polices while stld offers meaningful upside with less volatility 
the market has clearly rewarded machinery names for their exposure 
increased infrastructure spending and our space post election 
despite management commentary suggesting incremental top line growth 
the machinery side acknowledge the potential for meaningful earnings 
from infrastructure bill will not hit until investors remain optimistic 
upside and beyond should the current infrastructure proposal get 
the growth prospects for our coverage 
passed and implemented planned however construction equipment 
manufacturers must first work through excess inventory and pricing 
headwinds further our stocks are post election which some cases 
does price the earnings upside calculate highlight uri best 
positioned from policy themes scenario where both corporate tax reform 
and meaningful infrastructure spending increases get passed their proposed 
form 
steel 
our making steel investable again note conservatively estimate 
trump stimulus plan would increase steel demand annually for 
years and analyzed how spending could affect steel use infrastructure projects first 
had make some assumptions the division the annual spend between various 
types projects since the only detail stated the plan for money spent 
roads bridges tunnels airports railroads ports and waterways and pipelines next 
converted the spend into units for each type project then looked steel use per 
unit and used that calculate absolute steel use number see below 
the plan our math would add about tons incremental demand each year 
after adding this current demand get consumption capita way 
cross check our results this seems conservative since the generally consumed 
capita from the late the global financial crisis our opinion 
infrastructure was adequately maintained during these years exhibit and then 
subsequently fell into period decay result believe our work leaves some 
cushion for changes the scope the program however even with our conservative 
view the impact the steel market would significant

increase steel demand annually over years

our view 
market view 
the cyclical growth strength the expense structural imbalance and 
some observers believe recent growth momentum the beginning 
sustainable growth upturn and growth china can remain around 
double the country gdp 
thus view another policy driven mini cycle upturn similar the cycle growth trajectory beyond the near term will weighed down 
structural headwinds 
the cyclical strength that started has continued for more than one year mschex growth was yoy july october slightly stronger than the average 
growth yoy meanwhile the official manufacturing purchasing managers 
index rose two year high november with broad based improvement across subindices suggesting that the growth momentum can hold keeping full year 
gdp growth our view the growth upturn has been largely driven strong 
fiscal support and credit expansion particular recent growth drivers are continued 
fiscal support infrastructure projects front loaded auto demand and still robust 
housing sector the back rapid increases household mortgages 
however the growth upturn has been the expense structural imbalance despite 
the strong cyclical momentum recent months are concerned about the 
deteriorating quality growth specifically there are three key symptoms 
increased structural imbalance 
rapid build debt suggests deteriorating return capital employed growth 
total social financing including net government debt issuance remained elevated 
around its two year high yoy over the past six months more than twice 
high nominal gdp growth the credit driven recovery has led continued build 
leverage currently from moreover the debt overhang 
problem has spread from the corporate sector the household sector driven 
rapid rise new mortgages amid the housing market rally the continued build 
leverage has led weaker return capital employed reflected sharp increase 
the incremental debt incremental gdp ratio from and 
growth led public investment with lower profitability and higher debt burden fixed 
asset investment growth has been led soes far this year while private investment 
growth has remained subdued the government deploys state enterprises 
economic stimulus efforts however widely recognized that soes china generally 
operate less efficiently than private companies reflected the weaker return 
assets and higher debt asset ratios soes than the private sector the continued 
boost soe investment thus reflects lack progress soe reform and loss 
efficiency the economy our view 
the state planned capacity cut has caused distortion the market taking the coal 
industry example response the persistent excess capacity issue policymakers 
imposed production day cap working days the industry february 
however the production limit was implemented all companies the industry which 
means companies that are more profitable and less vulnerable excess capacity are 
affected just much those with obsolete capacity and weak profitability meanwhile 
state planned capacity control policies distorted the market reaction demand 
changes leading surge coal prices since the end july suppliers 
have not been able respond with more production meet higher demand from the 
winter heating season recent months 
growth trajectory weighed down structural headwinds growth will likely peak 
and moderate estimate result slowdown the 
housing and automobile markets that said the growth deceleration will remain 
mild growth stability remains policy priority before the political reshuffle late 
however the growth trajectory beyond the near term will weighed down

our view 
market view 
recent improvement inflation has been driven another round debt 
the region has managed lift itself out its disinflationary cycle and this 
will lead improvement debt gdp ratios 
build capital productivity has not improved and excess capacity 
challenges remain implying disinflationary pressures still exist 
debt build and persistent deflation producer prices 
debt gdp ratios for the region had risen from trough 
estimated facing collapse external demand after the credit crisis 
policymakers turned loose monetary and fiscal policies boost investment policy 
makers maintained high investment gdp ratios for prolonged period time they 
continued target relatively high rates gdp growth and exports did not recover 
the pre crisis rates growth the combination these factors has led the 
emergence the related challenges excess capacity and deflationary pressures 
indeed producer prices moved into deflation territory from march starting 
china and eventually covering nine out the economies that track 
inflation has been improving recent months 
recent months producer price inflation has been improving particular producer 
prices china exited deflationary territory september after consecutive 
months deflation ppi china has been positive for the past two months and now 
only five the economies have ppi deflation leading questions whether the region 
has now left the debt disinflation cycle behind 
can the recent tick inflation sustained 
the improvement the producer price index has been predominantly driven uptick commodity related segments the improvement producer prices electronic 
products which typically account for around about one third the non commodity 
producer price index has also contributed the upturn inflation this has occurred 
alongside upturn exports these items our view the improvement the 
inflation cycle the region has been brought another round debt build 
debt growth has accelerated from the trough averaging the first three 
quarters from the effects the debt growth boosted 
demand led stronger demand for commodities which spilled over into noncommodity related items the near term still expect producer prices improve 
the translation effects from higher commodity prices well the pass through from 
commodity prices into higher input costs for the non commodity related segments will 
continue feed through headline producer prices beyond that the levels 
capacity utilization will the key factor that will influence whether the improvement 
producer prices continues considering that utilization ratios are post crisis lows for 
number economies the region most prominently korea this will likely constrain 
the improvement producer prices 
will debt gdp ratios improve following the improvement inflation 
far this cycle persistent disinflationary pressures have meant that nominal gdp 
growth has been weak against this backdrop even though debt growth has decelerated 
from its peak still outpacing nominal growth leading rise 
debt gdp ratios stands there still significant gap between debt growth and 
nominal gdp growth hence even though the improvement producer price 
dynamics will lead pick nominal gdp growth next year estimated 
from the gap between debt and nominal gdp growth unlikely narrow 
significantly which will mean that debt gdp ratios will continue rise more 
fundamentally improvement productivity will needed for improvement 
debt ratios not expect this happen over our forecast horizon and hence expect 
debt gdp the region continue rise

phase illustrated below 
strong pricing power reflects the following factors better supply demand the 
industry the high competitive capability the companies with better channel 
management leading position their respective product lines balanced product 
portfolios and more diversified raw material base better operating leverage 
higher channel margins which provide better margin buffer defend market position

which has led more capacity build the pace investment growth 
not sustainable there will eventually sharper decline investments and 
larger credit risk issues industrial sectors the digestion high risk credit 
from industries with overcapacity will require large amount capitalraising the banks weigh severely economic growth 
different era for industrial sector demand and supply

economic slowdown could lead concerns about industrial npls this analytical 
framework remains entrenched but believe the dynamic has entered new era 
industrial investment and capacity expansion has lagged the pace 
economic growth notably 
notable capacity cuts various industrial sectors evidenced near npl 
recognition manufacturing loans have also sped the rebalance supply 
and demand for the manufacturing sectors whole 
majors banks remain cautious towards manufacturing loans which will lead 
continued slower industrial capacity expansion relative end demand 
expect the second year which industrial investment growth will 
lagging growth end demand more than five percentage points this combined with 
better than expected overcapacity reduction will change the supply and demand 
dynamic meaningfully our analysis indicates that the level real overcapacity 
around for some the industries with the most severe overcapacity issues 
most industries not need reach capacity utilization make money this 
new supply and demand dynamic will mean less npl pressure even economic growth 
slows bit from and actually see better industrial sector profits long 
economic growth can outpace notably the industrial investment growth 
also china economic structure has changed fundamentally services and consumption 
are contributing much higher portion gdp and gdp growth relative even

our view 
because the tightening cycle this time focused just cities 
versus nationwide the past the cities account for about 
nationwide sales and starts volume terms since the tightening measures 
october sales outside those cities have remained stable mom 
and are yoy also after two years falling construction starts 
lower tier cities because lower prices see inventory returning 
more healthy level which has resulted pick average selling prices 
this should motivate developers accelerate construction 
market view 
yes because tightening measures and high inventory lower tier cities 
the consensus view that most lower tier cities have high inventories which 
could continue put pressure average selling prices and new starts 
time play the recovery lower tier cities 
think now the time look lower tier cities this tightening cycle cityfocused rather than nationwide after two years falling construction starts inventory 
has returned healthier levels leading pick average selling prices lowertier cities expect the asp increase lower tier cities translate pick 
construction new starts least for the healthier lower tier cities first lower tier cities 
account for nationwide starts and estimate new starts lower tier cities will

among peers and dividend yield will drive stock outperformance

company has taken several initiatives build its customer database 
optimize tables between properties extend promotions and participate the

structurally challenged because design that suited vips and the

completely ignored the growth this property will slow because poor

the current reflationary trend started the summer not post the election 
the key macro topic for investors has been and remains the influence 
reflationary hopes portfolio construction the short term the reflationary theme 
looks extended given big moves financials and commodity stocks and sharp move 
down bond prices and defensives post the election such spike reflationary 
optimism can dangerous given the high political uncertainties that still exist however

macro newsflow should remain supportive the reflation theme 
from macro perspective believe that the reflationary theme has further run 
given inflation set rise further over the coming months given the large year onyear increases commodity prices through economic activity currently 
accelerating iii our bond strategists see yields rising further over the next few quarters

years although higher rates argue against multiple expansion our opinion 
should see the region first annual eps growth for over five years driven very 
strong rebound commodity profitability more and more moderate recovery

consequently believe european equities can provide investors with double digit 
total return over the next months 
although recent moves suggest some this now the price certain sectors 
given the significant rotation already seen within markets the last couple months 
pertinent ask how much the above now priced markets this regard

car most obviously powertrain but other components also affected new 
entrants from consumer electronics specialists oem sourcing oems face 
many challenges also but this partly reflected all time low valuations 
suppliers remain expensive history through expect greater clarity 
product developments oems plan production schedules for their new 
models continental strategic review its powertrain division expected 
likely see product write downs and new investment which 
expect set the tone for others 
announcements are significant but may not achievable suppliers are 
structural winners from future industry trends content per vehicle rises 
strong organic growth can continue justifying above average valuations the 
autos sector overall has underperformed this year and the over positioning 
has reversed but suppliers remain the best stories challenging sector 
through evs are unlikely see any immediate impact supplier 
revenues with the focus remaining top line growth opportunities writedowns are likely continental powertrain review but reflects historical 
company specific investment decisions rather than the wider industry

response the debate chemical investors globally have sought exploit the 
battery supply chain which has seen substantial valuation reratings for companies like 
umicore major player cathode materials for lithium batteries but ultimately see 
more value for composite and engineering plastics producers with migration evs 
for the autocatalyst companies there clear question that needs answered 
would offer more profit potential than existing gasoline diesel vehicle 
not sure the answer clear cut the autocatalyst market essentially 
oligopoly dominated johnson matthey umicore and basf where diesel vehicles 
offer the value gasoline vehicle world where evs take share from 
diesel that could problem there are guarantees lithium batteries succeed 
longer term the battery materials space more competitive and judging

amongst the older population brackets which typically represents bigger part the

euv orders are ramping and believe will the inflection year 
euv currently experiencing tailwind with new orders coming but

meanwhile not regard eps peak due longer 
duration moore law with asml investment carl zeiss allowing multipatterning with euv meanwhile higher growth expectations margins ramping 
with share services rising coupled with declining capex level post euv 
introduction will materially improve the already exceptional financial model with 
roic expanding from 
around the possibility ramping euv mass production and fears that units 
could disappoint being closer units less per annum also eps 
regarded peak with euv fully ramped the market also remains cautious 
the possibility reach gross margins consequence lower euv 
shipment expectations meanwhile the market has not touched the potential 
within data analytics and machine learning 
asml euv factory nearly fully booked for 
calculating how many tools would needed for the first industrialisation phase 
now have more information that both tsmc samsung ibm would use layers and 
intel would use layers but intel yields are usually lower can assume 
that the number required layers probably between for the whole industry 
with potentially wafers per month for the first euv node starting 
this would require wafers printed every month assuming 
wafers per day availability would require tools for that node 
assuming some additional capacity for dram with euv layers per wafer could 
expect total tools for the first euv node 
how many orders the first node will ramp within year period 
suggesting tool shipments the midpoint tools per annum hence could 
see scenario orders through volume purchase agreements note 
that intel entered volume purchase agreement for tools other words 
asml now allocation mode providing production slots key customers this 
consistent with our forecasts for euv shipments and 
beyond believe many investors consider the peak for earnings for 
asml once euv has ramped but following the investment into carl zeiss believe 
there theoretical bottleneck continue using euv into smaller nodes such 
and understand from discussing with asml 
management that samsung for instance has discussed its roadmap with asml until

monetary policy fiscal policy growth policy inflation and trade 
arrangements asia 
monetary policy the key issue how the bank japan links the new yield 
targeting regime economic indicators core prices are far the most important 
light the strong commitment inflation both tighter labor markets and the 
weaker yen will push prices upward 
market view there consensus but markets seem assume that the boj will 
keep the yield target now about zero indefinite basis but with little linkage 
economic indicators our view expect boj react primarily higher inflation but 
only after inflation passes threshold level about and stays there 
consistently hence expect yield target increases start only autumn see 
exhibit below moreover expect the first yield target increases widen the band 
practice the upper end only the key catalysts will statements

fiscal policy the question whether the expansionary fiscal stance will 
maintained into and beyond the uncertainty arises because the inconsistency 
between the large fiscal package announced august the continued commitment 
cut the primary deficit zero 
market view substantial part the market believes that the fiscal consolidation 
goal will maintained the expense growth our view believe that fiscal 
expansion will maintained and even extended well into beyond base this 
view several factors domestic demand not strong enough generate the 
growth needed trigger higher domestic investment there may upside risks 
domestic demand however light more aggressive fiscal policy that may support 
japanese exports there large need for infrastructure replacement roads 
bridges tunnels water pipes that are deteriorating quickly there need for new 
infrastructure for growing industries such tourism connectivity etc the key 
catalyst will statements from the council economic and fiscal policy 
growth policy the question whether abe will able push through more 
difficult reforms areas such labor medical pension immigration education etc 
market view most investors are skeptical that major reforms will occur and that 
reforms will sufficient accelerate productivity our view trust but verify 
abe has track record successful reforms agriculture corporate governance 
energy civil service rules and education however upcoming reforms are even more 
difficult labor healthcare immigration and taxation has solid majority the 
diet and strong public support however vested interests remain strong well 
moreover even current plans were fully implemented productivity growth might not 
achieve the growth rate needed hit the real growth target note labor 
force will likely decline about year productivity growth must contribute 
more than potential gdp growth the key catalysts will public debate and 
poll results 
inflation the question whether prices will indeed accelerate toward the key 
factors are external price pressures from commodities and the exchange rate and the 
balance between demand and supply the labor market 
market view markets believe that demand growth will too weak and that extra 
supply labor from women and the elderly will suffice offset demographic 
downtrends our view think that the rise participation women and the 
elderly will not offset demographic pressures moreover see sufficient demand from 
exports investment and consumption that the unemployment rate drops 
historical relationships suggest that such low unemployment will push wages and 
push the cpi toward the key catalyst will the speed and sustainability wage

brazil banks heading multi decade low roe 
morgan stanley llc 
jorge kuri 
jorge kuri morganstanley 
our view 
market view 
brazilian banks will see multi decade low roe from combination 
falling margins stubbornly high loan loss provisions and limited volume 
growth brazilian bank stocks have consistently underperformed the market 
bank earnings will recover from combination lower provisions 
market share gains limited asset sensitivity and spread expansion 
periods interest rate easing and don see why this time could 
different anything the combination falling rates amid the backdrop 
high npls and sluggish credit growth makes the relative stock performance 
more challenging 
brazilian banks are asset sensitive why there even debate our surprise some 
management teams and many market participants argue that falling selic rates will 
neutral even positive for bank profitability disagree for the most part bank 
balance sheets brazil are textbook asset sensitive very short term securities and 
loans where the book matures within months particularly the high margin 
loans large participation deposits funding including big chunk regulated quasifixed rate deposits and overcapitalized balance sheets furthermore repricing data and 
historical evidence supports this view 
see three key reasons wary about the likelihood significantly lower loanloss provisions next year credit quality and loan loss charges are typically lagging 
indicators economic activity gdp still negative territory turning slightly positive 
only until think delinquency and provisions should continue rise 
throughout next year are most worried about the job market continues 
deteriorate sharply the job creation data setting records every month unemployment 
will plateau some point mid best given the normal month lag 
between job losses and delinquency consumer npls will continue weaken the 
corporate side chapter filings are still moving rapidly and per central bank 
disclosure loan loss provisions for companies that have filed for chapter represent 
only the total exposure banks have those companies this also underscores 
the headwinds provisioning levels over the next months coverage ratios 
properly measured including restructured loans are below most 
the large retail banks even asset quality improves banks will need build 
coverage repair balance sheet reserves over the next couple years hence limiting 
the room reduce provisioning financial income much larger for the 
than loan loss provisions much the banks can lower provisions won enough 
provisions fall the ratio provisions average loans would fall and 
offset reduction margins provisions would have fall around 
average loans these levels provisions would unprecedented even the boom 
years the average ratio provisions average loans over the last years 
with high and low exhibit 
don think there meaningful market share opportunity for the private banks 
some market participants argue there market share opportunity for the private 
sector banks now that the government banks are supposedly going scale back yes 
the surface government banks took lot share over the last five years picking 
percentage points from their private peers however depth report 
published recently golden market share opportunity spectacular nothing 
concluded that there evidence that market share opportunity exists faster 
industry growth mortgages and government and lesser extent agricultural 
loans explains most the market share reshuffling brazil and the collapse the 
bank driven automobile lending market and the heavier concentration private banks 
had this product explain another chunk excluding these products the market share 
are arguably irrelevant 
lending spreads are mostly function benchmark interest rates hard see them 
moving rates are coming down the bulls argue that and spreads 
and nim the private banks fell rapidly public banks were aggressively pushing 
spreads down take market share and now that the government banks are 
supposedly going scale back there room increase lending spreads the system 
can find the evidence that supports this and fact the historical relationship 
between interest rates and lending spreads argues differently indeed the level 
benchmark interest rates the main variable driving spreads for the most 
representative product the lending market found that the correlation between 
spreads working capital loans and cdi rates varies from for any 
combination years exhibit the fastest and sharpest contraction selic rates 
brazil has seen years happened and this think was the main reason 
behind the falling spreads expect selic fall from its peak 
mid pretty punchy decline and this will very likely put lot pressure 
spreads 
historical evidence suggests caution bank margins profitability and stock 
performance interest rates fall indeed net interest margin and selic rates move 
and bradesco has closely followed the movement selic rates hard find 
easing period where net financial margins performed well interestingly found that 
selic rates and bank roa also show strong historical correlation with all time low selic 
rates coinciding with all time low roa 
brazilian bank stocks have consistently underperformed the market periods 
and bradesco have underperformed the overall market and most notably the 
magnitude underperformance closely related the magnitude the selic 
contraction the largest and fastest drops selic coincided with the largest 
underperformance banks versus the bovespa index note expect this 
example all instances over the last years when selic fell more 
month period the shares significantly underperformed the bovespa index exhibit 
moreover relative previous easing cycles the banks may face tougher profitability 
compression this time around given the lack credit growth all the previous 
easing cycles bank lending was growing healthy pace hence offsetting some the 
negatives revenues from nim repricing even nim and revenues did poorly and 
bank stocks underperformed for the most part this time around unlikely that 
volumes will provide any offset hence the impact nim revenues and stock 
performance could even more challenging than before exhibit

iron ore but also nickel and coal nor for the possible assets divestures that 
year however management able deliver the fertilizer deal that 
could take place mainly nacala project finance and fertilizer division that 
estimate additional divestures believe dividends next 
combined could raise

today the market needs focus much more oil prices than rate 
our view assuming functioning fuel price policy the impact bbl 
petrobras dollar linked debt requires strong brl make deleveraging 
possible petrobras highly leveraged the currency deterioration since

further legs say yes the stock can still double from current levels the stock 
ytd having materially outperformed the msci brazil benchmark which 
ytd predictably this strong outperformance started raise many questions 
the market but have high conviction that the stock can continue deliver positive 
returns the medium long term one also needs keep mind that earlier the 
year pbr was very challenging period when the market was pricing financial 
distress scenario making the comparison basis very low 
addition the upside see our price target identify three fundamental 
aspects that can potentially add more than incremental upside the current 
market price for additional details please see the fundamental value pbr asset 
base exploring value creation 
recovery rates the pre salt could generate incremental upside the stock 
there has been much debate around decline rates pbr mature fields but those 
represent only fraction value the real driver the pre salt which represents 
the total ascribe pbr and that takes into consideration 
expected recovery rate but pbr working many initiatives that could take
