wrap tax 
tax reform should deliver near term deficits the high end 
our base case range but well below earlier market estimates 
with bigger relative corporate cuts this drives modestly 
higher gdp benefit than previously forecast for now the 
impact asset class outlooks looks lackluster 
first want wish our clients wonderful holiday 
season and thank you for sticking with our first 
full year public policy research hope you got 
much value from our work and our process did 
from your engagement and feedback while tax policy 
wrapping for now expect will have many 
more policy issues market impacts for debate 
and discuss 
tax reform conference draft legislation 
approaches final votes offer the following key 
takeaways 
long term deficits meet our expectation but near term deficits came 
the high end our base case range while the year deficit expansion 
came our target year deficit expansion came the high end 
our base case range gdp gdp given efforts 
some policymakers front load economic effects within the political and 
practical constraints budget reconciliation 
moderate boost near term economic growth our economists point 
modestly higher deficit from tax reform expectations higher 
defense and disaster relief spending and more favorable than expected 
near term tax cut key positives relative year ahead expectations they 
combine produce gdp growth from yearahead estimates total tax reform effect total fiscal effect 
but panacea for the economic cycle the tradeoff for the lower thanexpected corporate rate est appears more mixed 
benefits the personal side and modifications some key corporate 
incentives from the way they were originally envisioned more limited 
expensing provision restrictions interest deductibility loss 
carryforwards higher repatriation rates stronger international tax 
provisions hence don see this sea change for the current 
economic cycle the fiscal impulse should fade and growth slow across 
what would make wrong the critical uncertainty corporate

key investor takeaways 
michael zezas todd castagno meredith pickett matt hornbach adam richmond michael 
wilson adam virgadamo 
while took longer than republicans initial expectations they started with 
summer their public deadline for tax reform appears comprehensive tax reform 
should become law ahead our own early expectations republicans appear 
have the votes advance their conference bill per recent media reports given the 
acquiescence key senate holdouts 
here are our key takeaways for investors based what should the final version 
the bill set become law 
policy michael zezas meredith pickett todd castagno deficit growth the 
high end our base case range but tax policy still became diluted relative early 
expectations 
lead with the same caveat offered before are being careful not conflate 
this policy potential economically stimulative the near term with its potential 
long term value competitiveness yet must focus the near term 
stimulative potential for the bill given the most definable impact for investors said 
differently gauge this policy ability influence investor expectations and market 
pricing must answer questions does catalyze substantial near term growth and 
does meaningfully extend the economic cycle the next section our economists will 
argue both questions due least part the bill dilution deficit expansion 
and key provisions 
the former first recall that coming into the white house was touting tax 
plan with static deficit expansion estimated around over years potentially 
including infrastructure plan that many observers assumed would add another 
the latter mistaken assumption our view but understandable one given the 
administration focus the size its plan hence near term deficit expansion 
estimates excess gdp were quite common our client conversations driving 
expectations gdp growth easily clearing the coming year sympathized with 
the notion that tax reform would get done with some level deficit expansion 
embraced deficit hawks with republicans creating accidental stimulus see taxes 
knowing half the battle december yet such wide deficit expansion 
expectations seemed misplaced the end the deficit aggression those 
proposals became subject political and procedural gravity while deficit hawks not 
appear ascendant the republican party least not when comes the issue tax 
cuts think their influence was implicitly felt here the adoption budget that 
allowed deficit expansion effectively setting the parameters for the tax action 
that because passing reforms without democratic votes would require adhering the 
strict deficit allowance rules budget reconciliation see tax reform deficits 
moderate raise the stakes october when gaming out what tax reform 
that met republican principles might look like within that allowance estimated 
first year deficit expansion gdp see fiscal policy life the slow lane

our economists detail the next section appears the final bill puts the 
deficit expansion that range about gdp when adding that expected 
spending growth total fiscal effects the economy are estimated lift gdp growth 
though the tax bill lifts growth further and compared 
with the previous baseline the shape growth remains the same much the fiscal 
impulse absorbed then less the initial impact fades before 
growth slows across fading fiscal impulse and with monetary policy 
restrictive territory 
those lackluster impacts are driven part questions about the power stimulus 
late economic cycle well some the other stimulus sacrifices that were 
made comply with budget reconciliation beyond the smaller deficit expansion 
consider 
immediate expensing became temporary and narrowed scope such that its 
practical differences from current bonus depreciation allowances became modest 
more fully explain this point corporate finance considerations 
transition tax rates were raised take bigger bite out repatriated earnings 
and their potential domestic reinvestment 
the price keeping the corporate tax rate near its target appeared 
creating more mixed effects the personal side and adding late cycle 
concerns burdening the most levered companies limiting interest deduction 
see tax reform implications for credit market september 
rates matt hornbach outlook unchanged year deficit size and 
deceleration remain core outlook 
while boosted growth expectations remain just below fomc consensus and expect 
them decelerate further the year deficit increase from the tax action 
unchanged the final bill hence don think meaningful repricing needed 
account for the present value future treasury supply accordingly maintain our 
conviction curve flattening going into 
credit adam richmond tax not bullish driver credit spreads 
for corporate credit our takeaways are follows first capping interest deductibility 
percentage ebitda for four years modestly better outcome for credit than the 
senate version the cap approximate that when capping percentage ebit 
companies would not see net tax benefit and that drops when 
instead using ebitda for the vast majority companies the interest deductibility 
cap non issue second push back the view that this tax change tax reform 
more broadly will incentivize companies delever their balance sheets the short 
term remember the cost debt still very low for most issuers even those modestly 
above the cap animal spirits have been rising and tax cuts may drive confidence even 
higher these dynamics are not consistent with conservative corporate behavior our 
view third the final version the interest deductibility cap remains headwind for the 
most levered companies and yet another reason remain cautious ccc 
bonds 
more broadly while corporate credit may benefit from aspects tax reform better 
earnings growth from the corporate tax cuts modestly lower supply repatriation 
becomes reality not see tax cuts this point the cycle bullish driver 
credit spreads short think credit investors should hope for anything that keeps 
the cycle going modest growth and patient fed the extent fiscal stimulus puts 
more pressure central banks anything think medium term credit cycle risks will 
not down 
equities michael wilson adam virgadamo limited payoff for bigger rate cuts 
tradeable top low quality rally potential 
the tax deal getting done sooner than expected helped drive the our 
price target earlier than our time frame and helped prevent correction the 
equity market october november despite international stocks pulling back either 
way can help but think our original call back june for market top the day tax 
bill becomes law still quite valid the only difference our view that may not 
mark the final cycle top but instead interim one that tradeable least 
something think about exit avoiding unpleasant drawdown the 
beginning could make all the difference starting what likely much 
more difficult year trade than assuming get tradeable top this week the 
bill signed why isn this the cycle top first breadth still too strong and have 
yet see any major divergences that regard second the tax cut bill didn just 
happen earlier than thought but the cuts are bigger too which can get higher than 
current levels particularly the euphoria stage persists result are open the 
idea that finally get pause reset sentiment and positioning january that 
could set for move toward our bull case just want 
very clear that such move would low quality one from investor perspective 
and rife with higher risk since would require much more speculative excitement 
short would very different from the high quality risk adjusted returns 
experienced which investors should take into consideration 
part the risk this part the rally comes from tax already being the price 
equities and likely rise ahead volatility dispersion earnings estimates estimates 
for companies will likely have upward pressure for the next several quarters from 
tax reform but isn clear that estimate dispersion will remain muted been 
think that both analysts and companies are all over the place their interpretation 
the tax law changes and not clear that companies will prepared confidently 
provide guidance january the net effect for earnings such circumstances 
companies generally err the side conservatism relative what the market may 
now assuming any event will likely lead more dispersion analyst estimates 
and hence potentially higher volatility prices 
counting the fiscal impulse 
ellen zentner robert rosener michel dilmanian molly wharton 
three key items have affected the forecast relative our year ahead base case 
year tax cuts deficit expansion appear higher potential for modest 
further growth defense and disaster spending modestly more simulative 
policy mix evidenced deeper corporate than personal tax rate cut 
expectations further assume additional response from monetary policy 
financial conditions 
key takeaways 
the impact the deficit gdp ratio front loaded raising our forecast 
and 
have raised our gdp growth forecast additional 
gdp growth lifted 
this brings the total gdp fiscal impulse 
personal income tax cuts contribute the biggest delta real 
disposable income gets immediate lift and any additional impulse 
investment kicks with lag the consumer impulse fades while 
investment remains supported permanently lower tax rate 
fiscal policy lifts aggregate demand well supply side factors leaving 
room for faster growth without greater spillover inflation pressures our 
core inflation forecast calling for mild rise remains unchanged amid low 
inflation assume the fed does not feel the need hike faster and 
continue look for three rate hikes next year 
the deficit 
our updated estimates see the budget deficit widening from gdp fiscal year 
and expansion per year and 
wider than our prior estimates exhibit while the majority the update the result 
more front loaded tax package that will implemented earlier than expected 
about the change also reflects expectations for even larger spending 
disaster relief and national defense compared with our previous baseline 
the overall deficit impact the tax cuts and jobs act roughly expected but its 
distribution more front loaded than assumed according the jct score nearly 
the trillion static deficit expansion over the year budget window will 
effect within the first two fiscal years enactment and moreover earlier 
passage means the effects are longer spread out over and but fully 
impact the budget deficit from the start calendar year 
also expect additional deficit spending from third round disaster relief and 
increased defense spending according politico the white house has requested 
additional funding for disaster relief which combined with the 
already approved would amount almost total aid assume there will 
minor spending cuts that partially offset this amount and that spread over two 
years 
terms defense spending press reports indicate that republicans may able 
raise the budget caps around both and with overseas 
contingency operations adding additional spending per year such

also update our forecasts for the current account balance exhibit now see

results higher imports and wider trade deficit the other hand and detail

january implementation means that all workers will begin receiving greater takehome pay immediately with their first paycheck one half year sooner than our base

inflation and monetary policy 
the modest upward revision gdp and has not resulted upgrade 
our inflation forecasts the expected path for monetary policy

depressing core inflation see what eating away inflation september

ending year over year rising modestly year end where 
flattens out over 
additionally implicit our assumption for stronger investment are supply side driven 
dynamics faster pace productivity holds inflationary pressures minimum with 
little flow through domestic service prices 
the path for policy continue see fed that deeply concerned with the 
persistent undershoot its inflation goal based our forecasts believe the 
fed willing allow the economy grow even faster pace ensure the return 
core pce inflation its goal over the medium term continue look for three 
hikes march june september which brings the mid point the target federal

curve expect the fed pause and take stock the tightening financial conditions 
bringing the tightening cycle end expect two final hikes march and 
june where the mid point comes rest restrictive territory 
below are excerpts from chair yellen following the december meeting the 
federal open market committee regarding tax policy 
chair yellen and the consensus fiscal policy december fomc 
most participants incorporated fiscal assumptions their forecasts 
most colleagues factored the prospect fiscal stimulus along the lines 
what being contemplated congress into their projections 
think colleagues and are line with the general expectation among most 
economists that the type tax changes that are likely enacted would tend 
provide some modest lift gdp growth the coming years 
those assumptions included both demand and supply side dynamics 
colleagues and mainly see the likely tax package boosting aggregate demand 
but also having some potential boost aggregate supply changes the 
corporate tax side the reduction the corporate tax rate expensing will lower the 
cost capital and while there are range estimates and uncertainty about how 
much stimulus that will provide investment general would see some stimulus 
investment 
terms aggregate supply effects stronger pace investment could boost 
capital formation and thereby raise productivity growth and potential gdp 
output some extent exactly how large those effects might remain uncertain 
but that channel suppose also possible uncertain how significant this 
would be that lower marginal effective tax rates for those groups that will see 
them could boost labor supply 
the impact tax policy had little effect the monetary policy outlook 
the extent that there are larger impacts than those analyses assume 
aggregate supply potential gdp the context economy that has had 
disturbingly low productivity growth that would welcome and could support 
faster gdp growth least for some period without creating need tighten 
monetary policy offset that there are potentially both demand and supply 
effects here importantly you really don the end the day see very much 
change the federal funds rate path 
continue think you can see from the projections that gradual path rate 
increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants now factoring their 
impact the tax policy 
generally you see modestly faster growth over the next couple years which 
consistent and said think for most participants reflects partly impact from 
taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending but not gigantic increase 
growth relative september you see lower path for unemployment but 
remember that inflation has also been running low persistent basis and the 
committee does have concern about inflation you might think well shouldn see 
more well okay growth little stronger the unemployment rate runs bit lower 
that would perhaps push the direction slightly tighter monetary policy but 
again counterbalancing that that inflation has run lower than expected and 
you know could take longer period very strong labor market order 
achieve the inflation objective 
corporate finance considerations 
todd castagno 
the final bill includes some revisions relative the house and senate versions that are 
varying consequences investors herein summarize the most pertinent them 
interest deductibility first ebitda then ebit 
the conference bill would limit net interest deductibility taxable ebitda 
through and taxable ebit and thereafter perhaps most notable 
the conference bill dropped additional restriction included both house and senate 
bills that would have also limited interest deductibility multinational 
consolidated leverage these controversial and complex provisions would have likely 
limited interest deductibility for many multinationals firms well below the 
ebit ebitda thresholds 
immediate expensing mixed bag 
the conference bill effectively adopts the senate bill expensing provisions full 
expensing permitted for qualified property placed service before immediate 
expensing then phased down each year until upfront 
etc qualified property generally limited non real property with asset lives 
under years the margin expect continuation this policy only 
incrementally stimulative consider 
expensing has existed the rate since thus effectively 
continuation status quo policy 
while appears significantly more favorable than today important 
note that the sits top already accelerated depreciation schedule 
for instance estimate the net present value added from switching full 
expensing from only cents per dollar investment year property 
further very important consider how this policy limited its interaction with 
the related policies for instance net operating loss carry forwards and interest 
deductibility for capex intensive industries immediate expensing often results 
companies spending themselves into taxable loss position losses are generally not 
refundable but under current law may carried forward for years offset future 
taxable income losses must also generally used before other incentives such tax 
credits thus limiting their value this often means companies cannot immediately and 
fully monetize the benefits immediate expensing today reason cited for the 
election rate bonus depreciation 
the conference bill modifies losses both positive and negative ways the positive 
losses can carried forward indefinitely without expiration however the bill would 
significantly limit the use any losses any year taxable income this would 
further dilute the monetization factor lengthening the npv losses carried forward 
would more constructive the efficacy immediate expensing stimulus 
the conference would have allowed tax carry forward losses accrue annual real 
rate return mitigate time value decay prescribed the house bill 
immediate expensing also interacts with new interest deductibility limitations 
discussed above interest deductibility limitations shift from ebitda base ebit 
base this ebit cliff incentivizes companies pull forward some debt financed 
capital investment before acquiring and immediate expensing investment under 
ebitda regime would effectively remove amortization headwind ebit that 
investment would otherwise cause acquired and beyond that said don 
believe this dynamic will material for investment 
one last note the conference bill removes current law limitation that the original use 
the qualified property must commence with the taxpayer the removal this 
limitation will likely lead more taxable asset acquisition structures acquirers 
may achieve more favorable npv tax benefits for qualifying property 
repatriation tax higher again 
the conference bill further ratcheted the mandatory tax retained foreign earnings 
cash backed earnings and all other earnings companies will have the 
option pay the deemed tax over years with back loaded installments allowing 
the tax due years and 
enacted the would operate territorial style regime that would exempt 
most foreign source income from taxation subject base erosion features discussed 
below the deferral mechanism that led today trapped cash phenomenon would 
removed and multinationals would largely unrestricted with their use 
foreign source profits 
protecting the base 
order transition territorial style system both house and senate bills contain 
safeguard features protect the tax base the conference bill closely follows the 
senate bill base erosion provisions 
gilti included the global intangible low taxed income gilti provision which acts 
form global minimum tax foreign source intangible income earned 
multinationals under the bill gilti income would receive deduction and would 
allow foreign taxes paid offset any tax this results effective 
minimum tax range and depending foreign taxes paid the 
deduction reduced resulting equivalent range and 
fdii the conference bill also retains incentive for multinationals retain and locate 
within the united states the foreign derived intangible income provision fdii 
patent box like mechanism that would provide domestic corporations with near 
symmetric deductions gilti for foreign profits earned from based intangibles the 
deduction would reduce the tax this foreign source income through 
and and thereafter believe this provision will greatly benefit 
multinationals with large foreign customer bases that currently have significant 
domiciled within the united states likely due revenue constraints the conference bill 
did not include related sweeter the senate bill that would have permitted firms 
from redomiciling the low tax basis 
beat the conference bill also retains the senate bill base erosion anti abuse tax 
beat that seeks combat base eroding intercompany transactions that concentrate 
deductions within the united states under the provision multinational required 
pay tax equal the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year the base 
erosion minimum tax amount the excess the modified taxable income which 
excludes base eroding payments over amount equal the regular tax liability 
which includes base eroding payments for the base erosion tax reduced 
note intercompany purchases inventory and cost goods sold are not considered 
the beat thus the beat may not capture base eroding payments imbedded within 
intercompany inventory transactions the conferees added significant adjustment that 
would allow foreign tax credits offset the tax this particularly significant 
for the renewables market that rely intercompany transactions support the taxequity financing note the conference bill does not contain version the house bill 
excise tax that would tax certain intercompany transactions gross basis companies 
that appear most exposed the beat are profitable firms with high sales 
concentration but low pretax profit concentration 
interest stripping noted above the conference bill dropped additional restriction 
included both house and senate bills that would have also limited interest 
deductibility multinational consolidated leverage corporations will 
now generally limited the ebitda ebit rules
