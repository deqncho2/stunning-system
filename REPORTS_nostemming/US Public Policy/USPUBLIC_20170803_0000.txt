before dig into our key lessons think important make the following 
point the actions taken the administration date are likely already reflected 
risk markets investors should focus future regulatory efforts support our 
point let first consider what the new administration has been able achieve and how 
much that action the repeal and delay not yet implemented rules hence the 
fundamental impact these actions indeterminate and some may not endure 
additionally there guarantee that won see further regulatory actions despite 
the intent the president given the dictates existing law the fda announcement 
last week regarding heavier nicotine regulations being key example see the 
regulatory endgame begins key questions after fda friday july 
consider the following

and the president used overturn final rules created the tail end the 
obama administration the cra allows congress review rules that had been 
sent congress for their review within the last days and because the trump 
administration now running the agencies unlikely that this will 
available tool going forward however congress may use the cra overturn

delayed action new agency heads have delayed implementing rules created under 
the obama administration but some those delays are facing legal challenges 
delays have traditionally occurred the early days new administration 
without opportunity for public comment but open legal question 
whether that allowed for example the environmental protection agency 
announced that would pause implementation the methane rule for two years 
works rewrite the rule environmental groups sued and federal appeals 
court ruled that the epa had overstepped its authority trying delay the rule 
and ordered the epa move forward with implementation after two week 
reprieve the court appeals for the district columbia ordered the epa 
enforce the rule july and legal challenges may continue this 
clear example the limitations the agencies abilities delay the 
implementation rules this limitation why the secretary labor alexander 
acosta announced that the department labor found principled legal basis 
change the implementation date the fiduciary rule while worked revise 
presidential memoranda and executive orders president trump signed orders 
instructing several agencies review specific rules and undertake regulatory 
actions more broadly see below however the president cannot unilaterally 
nullify rule all regulatory actions still have follow the lengthy legal process 
see reregulation burdensome time consuming and subject legal 
challenges

requiring that for every one new regulation issued least two prior regulations identified for elimination

the vague impact most the above somewhat incongruent with the faith inspired 
such actions reflected survey data that jumps those sentiment indicators 
coincided with the post election risk rally suggests that markets are already baking

the election from september december and points march

october high january before leveling off slightly

what want investors take away from the above that for regulatory efforts 
meaningful market driver going forward argue that measures with tangible 
impact are required the section that follows discuss why those impacts are 
elusive the macro level but are available key sectors 
trump regulatory agenda five takeaways for investors 
key takeaways 
deregulation motivation among republicans high 
yet the law and political climate dictate that reinterpreting regulations 
reregulation through executive action more likely than removing regulations 
deregulation through legislation 
executive reregulation action burdensome time consuming and subject 
legal challenge 
the impact reregulation for investors more micro than macro abstract 
outcomes plus lack demonstrable links near term economic growth make 
question stimulus potential 
micro sector based impacts include clear benefits the financial sector and 
signposts for directional impact pharma telecom and industrials 
deregulation key republican goal 
republicans have long stated that they want cut harmful regulation unleash 
economic growth the trump administration considers deregulation goal unto itself 
and included three mentions regulatory changes then candidate trump day 
action plan make america great again meeting with ceos shortly after the 
inauguration president trump stated think can cut regulations percent 
maybe more but percent omb director mick mulvaney included curbing 
unnecessary regulation his recent wall street journal introducing 
maganomics outlining the trump administration economic plan for achieving 
sustained economic growth wrote much like commonsense tax reform rolling 
back unnecessarily burdensome regulations will reduce the cost doing business 
the office information and regulatory affairs oira executive branch office 
tasked with reviewing economically significant rules and guiding regulatory policy for 
the administration recently issued its unified agenda biannual report the 
regulations agencies plan issue the near and long term under the new 
administration agencies withdrew actions proposed the fall agenda under 
the obama administration and reclassified actions long term inactive 
unclear from the data how many the rules were considered economically significant 
with effect the economy million more but did indicate that there 
were only proposed economically significant regulations less than fall 
reregulation more likely than deregulation 
while deregulation the republican goal what likely politically and legally 
achievable reinterpretation existing regulation governed existing laws which 
are calling reregulation this distinction important for investors see the 
former clearly definable reduction the regulatory burden for industry and 
the economy whole with foreseeable starting point time the latter holds the 
potential for reducing regulatory burden but lesser manner difficult define 
future point time 
explain further define deregulation the wholesale undoing policies created 
legislation which necessitates congressional approval those rules are function 
rulemaking process executive branch agencies after the passage new legislation 
the agencies undertake rulemaking prescribed laws passed congress rule 
defined any agency statement general particular applicability and future effect 
designed implement interpret prescribe law policy describing the 
organization procedure practice requirements agency and the rulemaking 
process dictated law through the administrative procedure act and long standing 
executive orders the judiciary branch also plays role forcing rule creation since 
failure make rules that effectively enforce the laws passed congress opens the 
government lawsuits 
hence true deregulation requires laws repealed rewritten don see much 
scope for this happen given the lack credible bipartisan path toward 
deregulatory legislation because republicans not hold seat majority the 
senate their path forward for legislative change narrow republicans can use the 
reconciliation process pass legislation affecting spending revenue with votes 
but leadership has already indicated that would attempt use reconciliation 
health care reform for and use for tax reform see summer the 
swamp june therefore any other legislation will most likely require 
democratic votes pass the senate this limits what republicans can accomplish 
through legislation achieve their policy goals 
for instance the house representatives passed the financial choice act which would 
change many the policies created the dodd frank act however because 
needs secure eight democratic votes widely believed that this legislation will 
not advance the senate and hence will not become law republicans and 
democrats could come together some legislative changes dodd frank not 
clear that there time the crowded legislative calendar get them passed any 
time soon see summer the swamp june thus the regulatory agencies will 
revisit existing regulation under existing law 
accordingly the opportunity change regulations lies primarily executive branch 
action specifically the president can instruct his agencies through executive orders and 
informal requests review and revise rules through the rulemaking process dictated 
law through the administrative procedure act and long standing executive orders 
agencies can also undertake this action their own some areas appointment key 
personnel who may more lenient enforcement could constitute effective 
loosening the regulatory burden either case view these action reregulation 
more than deregulation reregulation under the right conditions can dilute blunt 
the impact current regulation changing regulatory rules enforcement 
activities however success this regard typically achieved only over time and must 
navigate legal restrictions sam watkins from american action forum stated 
history any guide the vast majority deregulatory actions will take place the 
margin existing rules 
reregulation burdensome time consuming and subject 
legal challenges 
amend repeal existing rule agencies must provide reasoned analysis for the 
change and through the same rulemaking process that originally created the rule 
policy statements and other agency guidance that did not through the rulemaking 
process and not have the force and effect law can changed more quickly for 
example the occ fed and fdic are responsible for issuing leveraged lending guidance 
which could changed without going through the rulemaking process but would still 
require interagency coordination however much the regulatory changes that would 
dependably impact investors not fall under this category 
the rulemaking process requires much effort and diligence ensure compliance with 
existing statutes 
sources morgan stanley research congressional research service office the federal register 
notes executive order requires covered agencies assess costs and benefits for economically significant rules the proposed and final rule stage economically significant rules have annual effect the economy 
million more adversely affect material way the economy sector the economy productivity competition jobs the environment public health safety independent regulatory agencies are not subject the 
oira cost benefit analysis congressional research service oira has calendar days review proposed and final rules but there penalty oira fails meet the deadline the average length reviews 
economically significant rules was days days and days congressional research service 
not surprisingly then the process tends time consuming one because the 
rulemaking process varies agency and the complexity the rule being proposed 
timing complete the process can vary the government accountability office 
published report that reviewed major rules and conducted case studies 
the rulemaking process while admitting that the information available was limited 
concluded that the average time needed complete rulemaking across the case 
studies was about four years with range from about one year nearly years with 
considerable variation among agencies and rules gao found that its case studies the 
length time between publication the proposed rule and final rule the federal 
register ranged from approximately six months five years 
although the administration has made clear that regulatory reform priority 
unknown whether agencies will able act accelerated timeline because the 
rulemaking process bureaucratic one president trump can influence the outcome 
regulatory reform naming political appointees fill the relevant positions each 
agency currently the administration behind naming appointments critical 
positions that require senate confirmation agencies have begun form deregulation 
teams that are reviewing regulations and new york times and pro publica investigation 
found that many political appointees most whom not require senate 
confirmation have deep industry ties and potential conflicts however these agencies 
still have through the legal process make changes regulations 
july the senate confirmed neomi rao lead the office information and 
regulatory affairs oira which reviews proposed and final rules rao directed the 
center for the study the administrative state george mason university antonin 
scalia law school and seen strong voice against regulation the head oira 
rao ultimately accepting rules once reviewed sending them back 
reworked decision that can expedite impose extensive delays rules oira reviews 
economically significant rules rules that have annual effect the economy 
million more twice the process and the average length each review was days 
down from days the new york times posited that because 
regulatory reform legal process sizeable part rao new job might involve 
helping the trump administration stay within the law pursues the changes 
additionally judicial review can slow and derail the process rules are subject 
judicial review and there wide body case law that applies rulemaking the most 
common standard review that courts apply the arbitrary and capricious standard 
although agencies are not held heightened standard when repealing changing 
rule the agency must display awareness that changing its position and provide 
reasoned analysis for the change the agency proposing new policy that rests 
upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy where the 
previous policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must taken into 
account the agency may required provide more detailed justification the rule 
can also challenged for not following the proper procedure required law for 
these reasons behooves the agency properly follow rulemaking procedure 
not have their rule challenged court 
democratic attorneys general are already preparing and some cases have already 
begun file lawsuits challenge agencies that attempt roll back legislation karl 
racine the attorney general the district columbia and chairman the 
democratic attorneys general association has said that democratic ags will make sure 
the administration changes regulations appropriate and legal way and pointed out 
that the justice system appropriate and legal doesn mean immediate arbitrary

reregulation benefits are more micro than macro 
for reregulation efforts investment catalyst must start from the premise 
that they will have credible impact the fundamental health the sector and 
timely manner this basis think investors would better focus sectorspecific impacts than macroeconomic impacts said differently focus regulatory 
changes for sector and security selection but not for big picture asset allocation and 
risk asset forecasting 
focusing first the macro note that there consensus the near term impact 
regulation calling into question the reliability macro stimulus from reregulation 
while don argue against the notion that deregulation should increase long term 
economic potential there appears far less evidence suggest its actions boost nearterm growth reliably rather the impact regulation the economy inconclusive 
and difficult measure report about methods measuring the total cost 
federal regulation the congressional research service stated estimating the total cost 
regulations inherently difficult current estimates the cost regulation should 
viewed with great deal caution not all agencies are required estimate costs 
and benefits for all regulations and the cost and benefits regulations can difficult 
monetize agencies are only required conduct cost benefit analyses rules 
deemed economically significant which are rules that have annual effect the 
economy least million academic studies the accuracy cost benefit 
analyses rules have found that the agencies frequently overestimated both costs and 
benefits regulations 
office management and budget draft report congress the benefits and 
costs federal regulation found that between and for regulations that 
had monetized costs and benefits the estimated aggregate annual benefits were 
between and billion and costs between and billion dollars 
review the academic literature omb stated that continues investigate the 
underlying question how regulations impact economic growth clear consensus 
has emerged 
economists have used multiple approaches try answer this question without 
achieving consensus using their database regulations regdata researchers from the 
mercatus center estimated the effects federal regulation value added gdp for 
panel industries over period years and concluded that 
economic growth has been dampened approximately percent per annum since 
from george washington university and the national association 
state budget officers concluded that there empirical basis conclude that their 
measurement federal regulation the budgets federal regulatory agencies slows 
job creation economic growth 
additionally although concede that reregulation should free bank capital the 
existence said capital isn sufficient condition for near term economic boost 
increase bank capital which discuss further below correlates with increased 
capacity for risk taking that could spur economic activity however this doesn 
necessarily mean that capacity will utilized near term stimulative fashion for 
example capital could deployed create credit and deposits via senior loan direct 
lending and indirectly through bond purchases another indirect avenue allocating 
capital market making businesses that facilitate credit risk taking through debt 
underwriting hypothetically said actions would turn increase the capacity the 
private sector undertake any number stimulative activities like capex importantly 
that capital could also deployed differently both banks and non bank firms 
stock buybacks and dividends are the most obvious example while such actions might 
mirror the fed intentions for use the wealth effect and the portfolio 
rebalancing channel mechanisms boost growth find that the evidence 
inconclusive their near term effects the real economy the key takeaway here 
that banks and non financial firms have options for capital deployment and they will 
likely use whichever manner boosts their return most favorably which may not 
include economically stimulative activity 
what then would convert this capital capacity into stimulative activity via greater credit 
creation increase credit demand that could achieved through loosening 
lending standards which expands the pool eligible borrowers yet the regulatory 
actions question financials don appear offer reliable near term downshift 
lending standards for example our housing strategy colleagues note that the treasury 
report appears offer path toward modestly looser lending standards but only over 
time and incrementally given the cautious approach banks are likely continue take 
mortgage underwriting the wake government lawsuits see looking loss 
severities june course greater credit demand could also result from 
healthier economy itself featuring more confident businesses and individuals here 
though capital deployment more the symptom than the cause economic health 
consider that although there was moderate increase demand and easing lending 
standards for residential real estate over the last quarter the senior loan officer 
survey slos has exhibited broad based slowdown loan growth well trend 
toward tighter lending standards despite bank capital levels improving recent years 
this trend was recently highlighted our corporate credit team see financial 
fundamental review june alternative argument that deployment 
excess capital dividends and share repurchases could contribute economic 
confidence through the wealth effect encouraging loan demand however that would 
likely take time and therefore cut against the notion excess bank capital being 
intrinsically stimulative the near term hence our takeaway that reregulation may 
hold some promise over time greater economic capacity there reliable link 
near term stimulus 
however discuss the next section reregulation could become investable 
theme the sector level under the right conditions 
reregulation already catalyst for financials what would 
make for other sectors 
although reregulation lacking macro investability little credible and timely 
macroeconomic benefits there are reregulation events key sectors that are 
investable 
believe that the strongest link financials where think reregulation should 
already treated positive catalyst though subsequent actions may further help 
for example the recommendations from treasury recent report bank regulations 
not need congressional action and expect that new agency heads nominated 
the trump administration will look implement several suggestions from the treasury 
report based their speeches and published articles eds while the changes 
being proposed the recent treasury report and others would still have through 
the time consuming rulemaking process our banks analysts estimate that such 
maneuvers could drive eps for the sector higher see treasury report boosts eps 
back pocket for money centers july this makes sense when you consider 
the capacity for reregulation change existing bank practices existing regulations are 
based recent law with broad purview but lacked precise descriptions 
implementation the dodd frank act the act was passed response financial crisis 
and had aggressive goals deal with the relatively unprecedented challenges the 
modern banking system now some years removed and with experience gained 
implementing new financial regulatory rules the treasury report suggests willingness 
and scope reform the methods dodd frank implementation with meaningful 
results hence think reregulation financials already credible
