japan policy outlook the nemawashi factor 
introduction 
the japanese policy outlook for unusually complex this complexity derives from 
the interaction several factors both constitutional reform and economic reform 
the two main issues are complex themselves the two sets issues interact through 
public opinion and affect politics the politics will affect prospects for the upper 
house election july first look the two main issues and identify hopeful 
policy initiative second examine parts the election system that will impact the 
policy debate third examine unique element the japanese policy process 
nemawashi japanese for behind the scenes but forceful pressure which may imply 
more positive outlook than consensus conclude have since with 
abenomics trust but verify 
the two main issues 
the first major issue facing japan constitutional reform the issue urgent 
light the changes the geopolitical balance north asia already the abe 
government has reinterpreted the constitution order allow more active 
participation the japanese self defense force sdf international peacekeeping 
operations 
however the constitutional status the sdf remains controversial throughout his 
long political career abe has advocated revising the constitution however his 
crucial coalition partner the komeito more reluctant part due this factor the 
ldp has yet publish final version the exact constitutional amendment that they 
will propose light the sensitivity and importance the issue constitutional reform 
likely absorb great deal political and media attention until the matter resolved 
the second major issue economic reform especially reforms make the social 
security system sustainable this issue includes several difficult elements such 
spending reform social contribution reform and regulatory reforms each element has 
its own set political sensitivities spending reform will inevitably reduce spending 
some categories and thus create political pushback further hikes social contributions 
which now total about worker wages split evenly between employer and 
employee would both difficult politically and harmful the economy regulatory 
reforms inevitably change rules markets and draw opposition from businesses and 
labor groups that benefit from current rules this context the government must 
choose its targets carefully exhibit gives overview the issues play 
where there room for action monetary policy largely exhausted source new 
stimulus little can expected from the bank japan fiscal spending already very 
high about trl total for all levels government consolidated with about 
trl for social programs compared gdp about trl there are substantial 
unmet needs education infrastructure and defense but the amounts available 
are not large enough provide significant stimulus tax policy the corporate tax rate 
has already been cut from and would politically hard justify further 
corporate tax cuts when the government raising both consumption and income taxes 
and may believe that further consumption tax hikes are needed and yet not everything 
paralyzed 
exhibit the policy debate 
source morgan stanley research 
spending policy incremental action possible with low interest rates the 
government having trouble funding deficits despite net bond issuance running 
about gdp hence modestly higher spending possible priority areas such 
education already the government has pledged spend about trl the revenue 
increase trl expected from the october consumption tax hike some further 
targeted measures may possible tax policy there some talk another 
postponement the consumption tax hike however abe himself has said that such 
postponement would occur only lehman shock level event hit the world 
economy see nikkei shimbun electronic edition october shohi zozei nichi 
shusho taisaku shiji that said there has been some talk allowing rebates 
the increment the consumption tax for purchases small businesses that adopt 
cashless payment systems 
hopeful signal 
the most promising development economic reform the meeting the council 
economic and fiscal policy cefp october the government announced new 
committee officially called the committee for promotion joint economic and fiscal 
reform this committee differs from earlier committees important ways first the 
committee relatively small with only members second there are businessmen 
one regional politician and accomplished academic specialists but representation 
interest groups exhibit that the density academics and businessmen higher 
than usual third the chairman one the businessmen takeshi niinami who also 
president and ceo suntory holdings but also member the regular cefp 
niinami has history strong leadership has used incentives effectively manager 
including incentives for better healthcare among emplyees and has track record 
success agriculture energy and healthcare fields

moreover the materials released about the new committee

the first section includes several items spending control

prevention and stronger incentives for effective use

reduced administration costs improved use abandoned

procedures this focused practical and dense agenda 
despite this intriguing start with all government committees the proof the 
pudding will the eating particular deadlines for recommendations are 
ambiguous although interim report may ready end seems unlikely that 
recommendations many sensitive issues will presented before the upper house 
election july 
constitutional reform think fast 
the political calendar will complicate the policy debate while the physical distance 
between nagatacho the equivalent capitol hill and otemachi the equivalent 
wall street only miles the foci attention are light years apart economic 
issues dominate the debate among investors but debate among japanese diet members 
dominated next july upper house election the reason simple for the ruling 
coalition the numbers are daunting exhibit 
the present upper house the ruling coalition along with small parties that favor 
constitutional reform number out seats with one vacancy exhibit thus 
there are exactly the number needed for the majority needed pass 
constitutional reform proposal that daunting enough however careful look the 
data shows another issue the ldp won bumper crop seats the election 
the very seats that are for election moreover there will more seats 
due the diet reform law enacted last june can the ldp and its partners retain

exhibit gives idea the historical probabilities such large coalition victory 
the eleven upper house elections over the last years the ldp alone has won 
average the seats stake the standard deviation pts the 
upcoming election even the other parties that want constitutional reform maintain 
their current seat numbers the ldp would need seats the new upper house out 
seats available that available seats this share seats equates 
standard deviations above the mean implying that the probability victory this

note the number seats can change between elections when election reform occurs most recently the size the upper house was raised from 
with three extra seats coming the election and the election 
source ministry internal affairs and communications morgan stanley research 
this statistical result consistent with the view widely held among ldp diet members 
that the party will unlikely retain the majority favor constitutional 
reform the implication that constitutional reform passed the diet and 
sent national referendum passage must occur before the july upper house 
election turn the implication this implication that politics will focus 
constitutional reform over the next few months not economic reform with consequent 
media attention 
there another fly the bouillabaisse law national referenda must held 
between and days after the diet passage referendum proposal for 
example the proposed constitutional reform were passed both houses the diet 
december then the referendum would have take place june 
since there are already elections for regional governments necessary april and for 
the upper house july scheduling referendum third election could difficult 
could referendum scheduled the same day with the local elections april 
the upper house election july perhaps one suggestion goes could abe 
dissolve the lower house and call triple election one day for the lower house 
the upper house and the constitutional reform agenda 
any these scenarios possible however there are political constraints first the 
komeito which crucial coalition partner for the ldp national elections not 
enthusiastic about constitutional reform second the komeito reportedly dislikes 
double elections much less triple ones thus for the ldp double triple election 
would risky strategy with reluctant partner that said such election might also 
the only chance that abe has achieve lifelong goal 
economic reform think slow 
nemawashi japanese term that has come mean 
quiet but forceful behind the scenes pressure 
interested parties the spirit behind nemawashi the 
japanese counterpart the western precept never hold 
meeting until the result foregone conclusion 
constitutional reform must addressed quickly due 
the need for majority passage the diet and the 
need for referendum however economic issues may 
addressed more effectively with slower timeline economic 
reform often involves deeply entrenched interests there 
are three ways engage such interests dramatic action 
slow consensus building and forceful nemawashi 
dramatic action worked well several previous issues such road reform and postal 
reform under the koizumi government more recently the decision enter the 
tpp negotiations was dramatic decision abe correctly estimated that majority 
the population would support trade opening measures even some the agricultural 
industry objected the strong outcome the upper house election for the ldp 
proved that this judgment was correct the political momentum kept agricultural reform 
moving forward for another year 
slow consensus building has been less successful seen the case work style 
reform when committees are large include very broad range interests have 
weak leadership then the matter question can stall addition slow process gives 
opponents more opportunity build resistance 
nemawashi has been remarkably effective some issues when implemented 
consistently and forcefully one example immigration although the abe government 
never uses the word immigration there have been several expansions the conditions 
under which foreign workers can enter japan including extension length stay for 
trainees moreover permanent residence status for foreign workers has become easier 
with the introduction points based system update the alien registration 
system made foreign entrants easier trace reducing fear illegal immigration 
recently after demands from industry the government expanded the number 
industries where low skilled trainees can work the government has also added another 
five years when workers can kept for management training fit these parts together 
foreign worker after years the country and with adequate mastery the 
japanese language could receive permanent resident status without much difficulty 
this progress immigration was made with remarkably little adverse reaction why 
because the need for foreign workers clear most the population especially 
small business moreover foreign workers have excellent track record for lawabiding hard work this example forceful consistent nemawashi could template 
for economic reforms 
nemawashi economic reform may benefit from one other factor the controversy 
surrounding constitutional reform will likely allow quiet rational debate economic 
issues investors may find the lack public attention economic reform disappointing 
but should not necessarily dismayed financial markets prefer dramatic policy 
announcements but real progress difficult issues can often better achieved 
through quiet nemawashi 
one concern about use nemawashi the urgency the economic issues there 
very little time left implement major reforms including extending working age 
controlling healthcare costs legal rules for fair compensation for dismissal adjustment 
pensions labor market reform before the baby boomers now starting pass 
become too old work hence once ready the recommendations made the niinami 
committee will have fast tracked order passed and implemented time 
light the election timing discussed above the second half after the upper 
house election will crucial 
conclusion 
the key conclusion for investors watch closely for forceful nemawashi especially 
the new niinami committee dramatic announcements are unlikely soon light the 
political calendar however the long term success the japanese economy depends 
crucially effective nemawashi because one the few effective ways 
overcome legacy interests key areas for nemawashi include spending control 
healthcare labor markets agriculture energy adoption education taxation 
fintech cashless payments and telecoms
