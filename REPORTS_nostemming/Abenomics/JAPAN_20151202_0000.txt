the next abenomics mild strong 
turbo 
abenomics entering new phase qualitatively new policies are 
the mark quantitatively however they fall short what policy 
combinations would achieve the goals japan moving toward 
such combinations and when 
success for the next phase abenomics means achieving three goals 
higher gdp higher investment and improved fiscal balance three goals 
require three tools regulatory reform tax reform and spending 
reform our small macro model calibrates the rough scale needed

varieties abenomics 
government statements the next phase abenomics are fully 
consistent with the direction our macro model results already 
anecdotal evidence suggests further progress some areas tax 
medical agriculture spending and labor market reforms however the key 
questions what spending cut and what taxes raise and what 
proportions have yet addressed 
the first half the most likely outcome mild next 
abenomics there would modestly higher gdp growth and investment 
and modestly lower fiscal deficits after the election there could shift 
strong next abenomics such shift would raise investment and lower 
deficits much more but the increment growth the short run might well 
modest 
source morgan stanley research calculations 
the micro level the next abenomics will likely bring more 
competition and investment especially labor intensive sectors continued 
restructuring industries and balance sheets and profit expansion 
sectors where deregulation spreads new technology quickly 
abenomics progress far

abenomics has solid track record aggressive 
monetary policy has helped raise prices and bring 
exit from deflation nearer while the overall consumer 
price index increase remains weak this entirely due 
energy prices which are set globally the contribution 
all other prices increasingly positive exhibit 
corporate profits have surged continuously beating 
analyst expectations significant reforms have been 
implemented agriculture reform the coop 
system taxation cut the corporate income tax rate 
implementation the number system 
government administration greatly expanded power 
for the appoint like minded bureaucrats 
throughout ministries and education enhanced rules 
encourage academic industry cooperation exhibit 
exhibit abenomics progress far 
that said all three arrows the first abenomics lost 
momentum over the summer the first arrow 
qqe quantitative and qualitative easing monetary 
policy faces the challenge increasing scarcity 
bonds buy the pace trl net buying per 
year the boj already double monetizing the fiscal 
deficits and thus must buy from the market however 
colleague kenro kawano points out the ability 
figu res exh rep resen jective 
institutional investors sell more jgbs the boj 
dgmen gress each area 
waning light the needs those institutions 
rce rgan stan ley research 
hold jgbs for business reasons while purchases 
other assets are possible the amounts available are far from sufficient offset the shrinkage jgb availability 
thus monetary policy may approaching turning point 
the second arrow flexible fiscal policy will have another tranche year end supplementary budget 
formulated offset weakness export markets however the size this supplementary budget will likely 
limited the tax revenue overshoot for the current fiscal year about trl moreover the adverse impact 
the consumption tax hike was far larger than the government forecast and another hike scheduled 
for april even more spending support the economy the face tax hike would merely tax and 
spend policies that are adverse the fundamental goal abenomics raising the growth rate potential gdp 
hence fiscal policy may also approaching turning point 
the third arrow growth strategy spur private investment has had some major successes mentioned 
above however the impact private investment has been disappointing true the ratio real business 
investment real gdp has exceeded the average but only barely and that ratio not nearly high 
enough bring significant increase productivity growth decrease the vintage the capital stock 
despite the solid track record far policies not seem sufficient for the next abenomics achieve the 
three goals what necessary 
japan economics december 
morgan stanley mufg research 
making the next abenomics work numerical parable 
order see what combination policies might bring success the next abenomics necessary have 
model the economy that easy understand puts the different parts abenomics together 
explicitly and generates numerical outcomes for different policy scenarios despite the many complexities 
believe that simply structured keynesian model can achieve this goal with few tweaks 
the basic structure the model identical all keynesian models gdp determined multiplier and 
exogenous demand equation such the exogenous demand includes items such 
government spending and the basic levels consumption and investment that would occur without any 
income profits the multiplier derives from values propensities spend tax rates and income distribution 
see appendix for details the model used for the results here note that net exports are not considered 
explicitly here because they are exogenous and thus their impact the outcome can subsumed the 
value exogenous consumption the scenarios for the next abenomics show interesting pattern exhibit 
exhibit the next abenomics mild strong and turbo 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
the starting point the base level which calibrated close the national accounts for assume 
that the tax rate corporate income that wage income and that there tax credit 
the value investments with the stated assumptions exogenous demand equilibrium gdp comes 
about trl equilibrium investment trl and government spending both government consumption 
and investment trl all levels close the actuals 
now come the scenarios the first scenario measures labeled mild next abenomics exogenous 
government spending unchanged but regulatory measures bring modest increases exogenous spending 
households and business the corporate tax rate cut from but the tax credit investment 
also cut from addition represent the scheduled rise the consumption tax and increases 
income taxes and the number tax system raise the tax rate wage income 
the results show progress toward all three targets gdp higher despite the tax hikes consumers light 
the tax cuts for corporates investment rises although modestly and the fiscal balance improves although 
modestly short mild abenomics brings mild progress toward the goals however these results would not 
likely viewed success because the progress modest what policy package might bring more 
progress 
japan economics december 
morgan stanley mufg research 
the second scenario strong next abenomics more aggressive all policies exogenous government 
spending cut sharply and one result that consumers spend more their own money goods services 
that were previously supplied the government did not change the marginal propensity consume out 
income although such change might occur consumers limit the drop their living standard react 
more the exit from deflation further deregulation triggers higher exogenous investment moreover even 
lower corporate tax rates cut trigger more investment well despite elimination the investment tax 
credit the results show much more significant impact outcomes although gdp does not rise much more 
than mild next abenomics investment much higher boding well for future productivity improvement 
addition the fiscal deficit nearly eliminated 
the third scenario turbo next abenomics would the turbo version improve the results much more our 
answer true gdp higher but the increments investment and fiscal improvement are small 
compared the strong next abenomics case 
one final scenario interesting tax twist next abenomics this scenario use the mild next abenomics 
assumptions exogenous demand and the consumer tax rate but shift use lose it corporate tax 
reform that instead cutting the corporate tax rate and eliminating the investment tax credit raise the 
corporate tax rate from the mild scenario but raise the investment tax credit from the 
mild scenario comparing the mild next abenomics scenario and the tax twist next abenomics 
scenario gives interesting result there not much difference this result has important policy implication 
since the abe government already committed more aggressive overall corporate tax rate cuts there would 
seem little room for increased tax credits for investment for wage dividend payments 
know what needed aggressive deregulation raise exogenous demand fiscal spending cuts and tax 
reform spur investment but keep tax revenue strong abe doing what needed 
japan economics december 
morgan stanley mufg research 
abe outlines the next abenomics 
the government highly aware both the successes and the shortcomings abenomics far indeed the 
private sector members the council economic and fiscal policy the top forum for planning the next 
phases policies issued statement september light the weakness china calling for 
tackling the top priority structural reforms breakthrough 
more potent response came from abe himself september announced new set three 
arrows the principles the new approach may seem vague most observers but think they are far more 
significant than meets the eye 
the first new arrow strong economy that brings hope achieve this abe collapsed the original three 
arrows into single one with simpler target nominal gdp trl compared trl while 
the target itself not significant change from the real growth nominal growth target heretofore the 
new formula concentrates the monetary fiscal and growth strategy goals single figure second abe 
used new term productivity revolution describe what needed revolution strong word for 
conservative politician and implies more aggressive attitude toward eliminating the ancient regime 
underperforming industries most important the merger the old three arrows into one new one has created 
room for redefinition political and social goals 
the new second arrow support for child care spin dreams the key element articulated early the 
speech commitment preventing the japanese population from falling below mln current trends 
the population would fall about mln the clearly stated goal raising the total fertility rate 
from recently this demographic task enormous and necessitates vast changes the social 
security system heretofore the japanese social security system has been oriented very heavily toward 
extending the lifespan the elderly regardless the expense for the young and working families abe 
new goal implies nothing less than wholesale redesign the social security system and wholesale 
reallocation spending 
the new third arrow reliable social security envisions nursing care system that obviates the need for 
people particularly women quit work order care for elderly parents also used two new phrases 
society with lifetime activity and support for elderly households self reliant while the rhetoric may 
seem soft the only way achieve these goals extend the working life large part the population 
thus addition womenomics abe has added seniornomics will require major changes incentives 
both carrots and sticks achieve these results 
short the next abenomics includes productivity revolution child care revolution and social security 
revolution this being achieved

hints from policy debates 
the direction policy measures some areas beginning emerge labor policy the june growth 
strategy included call for debate creating transparent fair objective and global standard level system 
for labor dispute resolution result the ministry health labor and welfare mhlw has created 
special committee apart from the regular labor policy commission consider the issue fair compensation 
for dismissal heretofore this topic was virtually taboo but the labor shortage and the need for more fluid 
labor markets triggered change heart the members the special committee only are members 
legacy labor unions business organizations one stated goal review the system monetary 
compensation for dismissal order address problems such fairness transparency and timeliness the 
current system reforms this area are crucial bringing more flexible fluid and thus efficient labor force 
tax policy abe has changed the leadership the ruling party tax commission and the tax reform 
agenda has accelerated particular the government now suggesting that the corporate income tax could 
cut further pts about pts more steeply than previously announced the extra cut would 
financed eliminating special tax breaks and thus making the tax system more neutral across firms

the business community objects the idea 
retained earnings tax course apart from fairness 
major problem with retained earnings tax how 
might affect the rest the corporate balance sheet 
firms simply borrow funds replace the equity the 
debt equity ratio would rise and roe would rise 
however the incentive for extra capital accumulation 
and hence higher productivity not clear contrast 
firms decide sell assets then the prices all assets 
would change there widespread belief that 
japanese firms are cash heavy according standard 
definitions cash however this not true exhibit 
the trl rise total assets between 
only trl went cash rather some trl went 
into long term equities this means that any retained 
earnings tax would have paid for liquidating 
large amounts long term equities the economic 
consequences might positive the result better 
corporate governance more independent firms 
however there guarantee that this would the 
actual result 
japan economics december 
morgan stanley mufg research 
the documents from the government this issue are carefully drafted the materials submitted the 
private sector members the council economic and fiscal policy the recommendation the reform 
the corporate tax system there should more visibility whether firms have assertive management with 
regard compensation capital investment and there should environment markets among 
institutional investors actively value assertive actions and create virtuous cycle addition among 
institutional investors important promote governance that focuses medium and long term 
investments and growth light this phrasing seems quite unlikely this stage that tax retained

the spending debate minister kono gets tough 
our model suggests key component for success the next abenomics fiscal spending control abe 
commitment spending control was shown clearly his appointment veteran ldp dietman taro kono 
lead jointly several fiscal reform portfolios within month taking office minister kono held public hearings 
elimination government waste much along the lines the budget screening committees 
has far examined effectiveness spending the ministry health labor and welfare career building for 
non regular employees nursing care support medical insurance support etc the ministry education 
culture sports science and technology national achievement tests english education activity supercomputer 
project sports promotion meti nuclear power activities the ministry internal affairs and 
telecommunications regional industry promotion local village promotion etc this high profile focus the 
efficiency spending emphasizes how serious abe about spending control 
will there enough the bar very high our economic model above there needs reduction 
government spending about trl this figure refers real government spending the gdp accounts 
now about trl total which trl government consumption and about trl government 
investment the proof abe intentions will come the new budget for due year end two 
points are crucial will overall spending cut with special emphasis spending regional governments 
and will the composition spending shift away from social spending and toward economic growth 
promotion 
kono was appointed simultaneously the minster 
for administrative reform civil service reform 
and regulatory reform also responsible for consumer affairs and food safety along with disaster 
management and the chairman the national public safety commission which oversees the police 
force 
budget screening refers open sessions non government experts review 
individual budget programs 
japan the idea was first implemented the tokyo foundation way aid local governments 
improving policy effectiveness with the change government the democratic party japan dpj 
instituted major highly public round budget screenings with significant impact kono then the 
opposition and long time hawk waste government organized similar set budget screenings within 
the ldp but focused projects that the dpj had not touched

the next abenomics mild the first half strong the second 
the statements abe the trend events and statements from the policy groups suggest that the next 
abenomics will very much consistent with the policies suggested our macro model however there 
problem degree with upper house election scheduled for next summer the ability openly 
aggressive spending cuts tax reforms and deregulation may limited hence expect only moderate 
progress although all three policy areas will see some 
true the effective outline the next phase abenomics from the people committee social participation 
mln proposed raft laudable measures early reduction corporate income tax rates iot 
investment for cybersecurity mobile communications improvements and small business efficiency energysaving investment for housing structures and transportation increased minimum wages ending the 
income tax distortions that deter spouses from entering the workforce the called mln and mln 
barriers regional systems for labor market intermediation and better agricultural exports increased 
availability day care child care and elder care order increase labor force participation increased aid 
for single parent families and free education for children from poor families 
surprisingly however there was virtually mention budget costs these measures the committee 
recommendations our view the reason simple any mention budgetary costs would bring the 
sensitive issue whether fund the new programs with either higher taxes spending cuts other 
components the budget with upper house election looming summer the government 
reluctance mention the matter understandable since neither alternative likely win votes 
after the election however there will opportunity accelerate the reform agenda with numbers 
attached abe term office lasts until september depending the results the upper house 
election may possible become more aggressive spending cuts tax reform and deregulation public 
opinion based results from seminars that give around the country general audiences understands 
the fiscal problem well public opinion also understands the need for strong economy support the social 
security system the remaining question the balance between spending cuts and tax hikes primarily the 
consumption tax needed stabilize the ratio debt gdp seminars around the country responses from 
supporters the center left dpj focus consumption tax ending the low range and social 
spending cuts about responses from supporters the center right ldp focus consumption tax 
the mid range with social spending cuts about 
expect the election seen referendum the next abenomics then fiscal policy will likely tilt 
toward more emphasis spending cuts and only moderate further tax hikes such result would form the 
political foundation for the shift from mild next abenomics strong next abenomics this shift would raise 
investment and lower deficits much more but the increment growth the short run might well modest

from macro micro what does the next abenomics mean for 
companies 
bringing the implications mild strong abenomics the industry company level herculean task and 
beyond the scope this paper elsewhere have shown that the most labor intensive industries medical 
restaurants hotels education seem the most ripe for reorganization demographic pressures persist 
order survive firms those industries will have reorganize and invest simply order raise profit 
margins industry consolidation will likely accelerate 
moreover the competitive environment will likely change corporate governance reforms and industry 
reforms proceed new business opportunities will emerge indeed agricultural reforms related the trans 
pacific partnership have already triggered new business tie ups between agricultural producers and 
logistics transportation companies ship japanese fresh produce asian markets the key factor will 
aggressive management that takes advantage the new opportunities 
finally see opportunity for profit expansion sectors where deregulation spreads new technology 
quickly for example the recent privatization some major financial institutions has been another spur for 
further integration payments systems heretofore funds transfer between the public sector institutions and 
private sector ones had been hindered incompatible systems now integration easier and cost 
payments likely decline similar changes are likely deregulation proceeds energy and other sectors 
short the likely winners from the next abenomics will the firms that substitute capital for labor 
aggressively reorganize and consolidate aggressively and deploy new technology aggressively
