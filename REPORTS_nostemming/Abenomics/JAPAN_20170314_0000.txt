the deadline approaches investors will need yardstick measure 
whether reform proposals will accelerate growth goal that abe himself 
set 
this paper first outlines the subjects discussed the council key issues include 
equal pay for equal work regular non regular employment overtime

labor and the proper role government propose scorecard for 
judging whether the measures will achieve the goals 
next turn the arithmetic labor reform and the macroeconomy labor 
reform may bring some upward shift participation but fighting strong 
demographic headwinds higher productivity must raise wages order for 
income rise even income rises must flow through the filters longer 
expected lifetimes and higher competition global markets before reaching 
consumption 
short growth will rise only labor reform broad deep and forceful our 
results imply that policy will most effective focused productivity and 
wages rather than further participation rate increases 
are optimistic that the end march proposals the work style reform 
council will contain important changes however also think that many

style reform 
recognizing the slow pace labor reform abe organized the council work style 
reform japanese hataraki kata kaikaku hereafter hkk intentionally made 
himself the council chairman way impart momentum the discussions 
the council convened september abe proposed nine specific themes and 
summarized the goal follows work style reform precisely the best method 
improve productivity work style reform not only social issue but economic issue 
must raise labor force participation rates and must raise wages 
other panel members had different goals for example rikio kozu the chairman 
japan largest union organization rengo said understanding that major 
purpose work style reform the complete elimination from japan excess work and 
related suicides 
this difference purpose key issue for investors should the pm broad view 
prevail then work style reform will indeed benefit productivity and the economy 
contrast should the narrow view rengo prevail productivity could suffer hence 
careful attention needed the degree progress the many themes mentioned 
the especially overtime rules 
see minutes hkk council sept the nine themes were improving 
the treatment non regular workers including equal pay for equal work raising 
wages and labor productivity correcting excess working hours such the state 
upper limits overtime hours promoting shift labor industries with 
absorption capacity employment support talent development and education that 
prevents ossification inequality flexible working arrangements such telework 
second jobs creating environment where women and youth can active through 
social security and tax reforms that are neutral work style promotion work 
the elderly support for workers with medical issues who have child raising 
elderly care responsibility acceptance foreign workers

equal pay for equal work 
there widespread agreement the council that equal pay for equal work should 
applied across work styles the key points are how identify different work styles 
how specify what should equal for each how ensure that information 
asymmetry does not give employers unfair advantage how establish dispute 
resolution mechanism that efficient well fair how prevent insiders big 
business and big labor from determining rules that serve their own interests the 
expense small firms and unorganized labor 
ensuring equal 
pay for equal 
work 
the proposed guideline published the government december there 
was notable feature the guideline included distinctions between types work 
hour based work results based work professional creative work and proposed that 
these distinctions the basis for judging equality moreover there would provisions 
require equal access training for all workers and require disclosure wage 
determination rules

regular non regular employment 
ending the 
distinction 
regular and nonregular workers 
major issue japan has been the sharp rise recent years non regular 
employment employees who are not full time workers and not employed 
indefinite period contracts the share such workers has risen around 
moreover another important distinction whether the workers are employed large 
firms non large ones since the latter typically fall outside the scope labor law 
enforcement especially when very small hence even regular employee small 
firm may not share the same protection one large firm 
the share non regular workers has risen for economic reasons first the cost 
regular workers higher because firms general are responsible for social security 
contributions for them whereas not for non regular workers second labor law 
least applied large firms makes reduction regular workers extremely difficult 
and hence makes firms reluctant hire them this reluctance has increased due 
globalization and exchange rate volatility 
the guideline proposal dec took clear gradualist position the matter 
the guideline said clearly the front page that goal the reform was seek the 
elimination the word non regular from japan the key factor will the degree 
which firms are encouraged eliminate indefinite term labor contracts and shift 
explicit ones key factor will whether such contracts are required include 
severance pay provisions one the key sources uncertainty will eliminated 
see cabinet office hkk council secretariat doitsu rodo doitsu chingin guideline an 
material japanese december 
under current law firms are not required have specific labor contracts with 
individual workers however firms are allowed have retirement ages which end 
regular employment given age this provision was made legal light the practice 
seniority wages whereby wages for workers rise every year according years 
service the result this system was very high wages for workers who had passed peak 
productivity even with official retirement ages there are constraints however the 
retirement age must not less that under then the firm required 
offer retiring employees continued work although wage subject alteration 
key debate prior the hkk council was about monetary compensation kinsen 
kaiketsu for dismissal under current law when dismissal found court 
unfair the company may not offer monetary compensation but rather must instate 
the employee and pay back wages ldp sponsored bill was drafted last year 
address the issue allow the firm offer such compensation but also give the worker 
the choice between the monetary compensation and reinstatement the minutes 
the hkk meetings the term monetary compensation does not appear even once 
overtime rules 
overtime hours 
one size fits all 
the most contentious part the hkk debate has been about overtime rules currently 
article the labor act prohibits more than hours per day overtime and more 
than hours per week however article also allows the employer and labor 
union majority workers establish agreement overtime hours although 
without legal force there directive the minister health labor and welfare 
that puts upper limits even article agreements hours overtime per month 
and hours per year with exceptions for certain special circumstance and blanket 
exceptions for certain industries such construction and transportation and for 
certain activities such development new technology the debate now whether 
shift mandatory framework with penalties 
february the hkk council secretariat proposed that legal limit 
overtime for all industries introduced hours per month and annual total 
hours certain cases where employers and unions agree the annual limit could 
raised hours but the unions would have the right check enforcement 
exemptions industry and activity under the current law would allowed with the 
approval the minister health labor and welfare also cases emergency 
such natural disaster the upper limits would not enforced the rengo 
representative said that this approach was line with union requests and said that 
would aid prevention overtime suicides 
when presented the february meeting the hkk council the secretariat proposal 
met with firestorm criticism big business leaders said that the rules would constrain 
business ability respond demand and raise productivity small business 
representatives said that the proposals would apply practice only large businesses 
and thus would worsen pressures for excess overtime small business some council 
members also pointed the lack application any overtime rules civil servants 
despite the extreme overtime hours worked some including teachers some private 
sector members and some ministers pointed out that one size fits all approach would 
constrain business lower productivity and weaken japan international competitiveness 
especially new industries 
abe then scolded the council said the matter establishing limits overtime 
hours extremely important and should not decided mere majority rule need 
consensus all members particular there need for employers and labor 
agree without such agreement cannot propose law have little more than 
one month before deciding plan the matter limits overtime has been 
discussed for many years the labor policy commission without conclusion that 
why established the work style reform council with myself chairman and asked 
representatives labor and business along with others debate want ask the 
representatives business and labor have frank dialog 
the subsequent meeting february the chairman the main business group 
sadayuki sakakibara keidanren and the rikio kozu rengo both reported that they 
had discussed the matter but had not reached conclusion march media 
reported proposal from these two parties but with quite complicated rules there 
indication whether other members the council would agree the 
meantime the issue becoming more urgent march media reported that major 
package delivery service would implement its own work style reforms giving drivers 
more schedule flexibility media also reported that major foreign investor announced 
that would evaluate firms part how they implement work style reform 
this writing the matter not decided the essence the issue whether onesize fits all rule will imposed and implemented equally across industries this 
contentious issue may require political decision the once makes decision 
however likely stick his coalition has large majorities both houses the diet 
that said the devil will the details and close attention needed 
another hidden rock lies below the surface how will wages and income adjust when 
hours change there was virtually discussion the hkk council how total 
income would impacted any change overtime hours for example hours fall 
but output remains the same productivity will have risen but there guarantee that 
workers will receive the same income they are working fewer hours the lack 
attention this crucial matter suggests that investors should pay careful attention

reallocation labor among sectors key source productivity growth japan own 
history during the postwar period testament the importance the matter 
large share the increase gdp worker from about mln terms 
about today came shifting labor from agriculture manufacturing and high end 
services japan today has the same problem how shift labor from low highvalue added sectors current labor practices impede such movement 
for example due the seniority wage system younger workers who often receive less 
than their product are effectively making deposit their firm the idea that the 
deposit will returned them their later years when their wages start exceed 
their productivity this combination lifetime employment and seniority wages 
effectively traps workers they cannot change employer without losing their implicit 
deposit should the worker get better offer from another firm then that offer would 
have offset the loss the deposit order impel the worker move even 
though both the economy and the worker might better off the worker does not 
move 
another issue mid career hiring there sharp distinction between large and small 
firms indeed the average personnel cost per person large firms was about 
mln per year but that medium sized firms only mln say that talented 
person large firm underemployed but could used better small firm there 
little incentive for the worker shift the smaller firm unless the offered salary 
were very high result overall labor productivity can suffer 
abe was clear that wanted change the hkk council said that wanted 
the door mid career hiring opened more widely through public private cooperation 
retraining job hunting and final employment several meetings the council 
discussed several proposals one would introduction clear labor contracts which 
specify worker rights and obligations when moving firms another would clear job 
specification that workers know what they are expected and how their future 
may evolve

foreign female and elderly workers 
where will new 
labor come 
from 
the hkk council discussed increasing the participation female and elderly workers 
and all panel members agreed that more action needed premature retirement was 
viewed significant loss efficiency for the economy the main obstacle for the 
elderly seems the health cost burden hiring the elderly contributions 
healthcare for the elderly are quite high and hence are barrier any move the 
government lower the corporate contribution healthcare for the elderly would aid 
employment for female workers whose participation rates across the age profile are 
already about the same those the united states and sometimes higher the 
arguments were more the same more support for households need 
daycare and elderly care more tax reform etc there was surprisingly little controversy 
although finding money the budget will struggle 
the discussion foreign workers included many areas agreement and surprising 
action has been taken already hkk council members agreed the pressing need for 
more foreign workers especially high skill areas such computer programing meti 
minister seko even noted that the anti immigrant trends some developed foreign 
countries were opportunity for japan attract talent abe comments the 
feb hkk meeting echoed this view fact fait accompli january the justice 
ministry announced that from april will grant permanent residence certain 
research and technical personnel after only year residence japan they apply 
current law requires years 
for less skilled workers however there remain significant disagreements most panelists 
agreed that the current trainee system far out date and has led abuses the 
question how fix one side the debate susumu takahashi who also 
member the council economic and fiscal policy proposed employment 
approval system for low skilled and non professional workers the system would have 
four parts company truly cannot find domestic workers would receive 
permission hire foreigners second the nation would negotiate immigration quotas 
with foreign countries and issue visas accordingly third within fixed period 
employment the firm would responsible for training fourth there would 
path for upgrading into the skilled worker categories and thus toward long term and 
even permanent residence 
contrast rengo chairman kozu said that foreign workers need guaranteed 
identical rights wages and conditions domestic workers and therefore that would 
problematic allow easy expansion residence status and work status for foreign 
talent 
abe sided with the more cautious view also the feb hkk council meeting 
said the matter bringing foreigners for fields that are not professional 
technical have taken the position that the issue must considered the basis 
national consensus from the viewpoints not only determining economic needs and 
impact but also from the viewpoints impact employment japanese impact 
industrial structure education social security costs and public safety want 
plan formulated the basis this point view

the role the public sector 
bureaucrats 
rules 
during the hkk council debates the role the public sector came two ways 
first how will the design the new work style rules impact the need for more civil 
servants and their power make blanket decisions for the entire economy the 
business and academic members the hkk council feared that enlarged laborintensive role for civil servants would only reduce productivity not only would scarce 
human resources diverted the civil service but the private sector would bear extra 
regulatory costs moreover since rules beget rules permanent worsening 
productivity was possible for investors evaluating the final proposals from the hkk 
council both the budgetary and regulatory costs the new provisions must 
considered 
another topic was whether new rules would applied the public sector itself 
during the hkk council meetings the minister education mentioned the 
extraordinarily long hours public school teachers the current overtime rules 
not apply civil servants and indeed the hours central government workers are 
notoriously long seemed odd several private sector hkk council members that civil 
servants would make rules for other people but not apply the rules themselves 
thus another standard for evaluating the final proposals the hkk council will 
their fairness and their regulatory costs 
see cabinet office minutes the february hkk council 
scorecard summary ten standards evaluate work style 
reform 
the scorecard 
light the above scorecard for the upcoming proposals hkk would need 
include the following questions 
are the purposes hkk primarily economic raising productivity wages income 
and consumption 
how much specificity will new rules require disclosure wage scales way 
reduce the asymmetry information between business and labor 
what the timeline for elimination the distinction between regular and nonregular workers will indefinite unwritten contracts for regular workers eliminated 
will the reforms include clear standards for monetary compensation for dismissal 
least requirement that such compensation specified labor contracts 
will the new rules overtime hours blanket rules applied all firms will 
determination rules left firms workers but with mandatory disclosure 
will there clear guidance maintaining total income labor even hours are 
cut who will reap the gains for productivity improvement labor business 
will the healthcare contributions firms behalf older workers reduced 
that the burden hiring lowered such workers would have bear more their 
own healthcare contributions 
will the door for less skilled foreign labor opened wider and what timeline 
what will the fiscal costs and regulatory burdens the new labor system will 
the system raise lower productivity after such costs and burdens 
will the new rules applied equally public sector workers and private sector 
workers 
the macroeconomics labor market reform 
abe goals for work style reform are clear must raise labor force participation 
rates and must raise wages but how much increase participation rates 
necessary how much increase wages and how much effort should put 
into each given the potential impact examine these questions this section the 
starting point demographics 
outline the logic 
the logic this paper see the next page necessarily starts with demographics which 
are the foundation both the number workers and the number consumers the 
economy the age structure the population can safely taken exogenous 
addition moves forward inexorably contrast the participation rates for each age 
group are relatively stable although they can shift over time either due social 
factors policy the interaction the age participation profile and the 
population structure that generates the labor force any given year japan 
participation rates rise from around age rise sharply the early remain high 
until around age and then fall sharply very few people work after age 
see cabinet office minutes hkk council sept 
the term profile here denotes relationship age for example the ageparticipation profile the relationship between the age group and the participation 
rate that group 
the big picture labor market reforms will change the participation rate and the agewage profile how will these changes flow into income and consumption 
source morgan stanley research 
once the labor force each age group determined need specify how much the 
employed members that age group are paid this relationship summarized the 
age wage profile for japan the profile shows increases wages for workers from 
about but declines after once the labor force and the age wage profile are 
known then income calculation easy just multiply the labor force each age group 
the wage for that age group 
the fun starts when look how inexorable demographic changes work through the 
age participation profile and the age wage profile and thus change income the 
calculation easy when the two age profiles are fixed however practice the age 
profiles are not fixed they move both with social changes and policy changes short 
when looking the prospects for income growth there are three moving parts 
population the age participation profile and the age wage profile 
fortunately the evolution demographics relatively easy forecast our 
calculations use the central forecast the national institute population and 
social security research that treat the path population given however the 
movements the two profiles are more difficult most important they are both the 
targets labor market policy thus order project income growth need 
calculate how the inevitable negative impact population dynamics can offset 
positive contributions from higher participation rates and higher wages hence the key 
question what does work style reform need accomplish higher participation 
rates and wages order keep income growing 
note that are implicitly assuming that everyone the labor force employed 
world business cycles one would also need unemployment rate profile order 
determine income however fluctuations the unemployment rate are relatively small 
and thus have omitted them 
how can work style reform raise income 
can work style reform 
raise the age wage 
and the participation 
profiles enough 
offset adverse 
demographics 
what would happen both the participation and wage profiles remain where they were 
the answer quite simple calculate since the only variable population 
exhibit shows the answer total wage income would fall about the 
labor force falls more than about per year the challenge for work 
style reform raise both the age wage profile and the participation profile 
enough offset the moves the population 
exhibit income scenarios with differing wage and participation profiles 
note the scenarios are labeled with the combinations wage growth and participation rate change wage growth denoted percent growth per year 
either while the participation scenario denoted the change participation rates percentage points per year pts pts for 
example the scenario assumes that wage growth for each age group per year starting after and that participation rates rise 
pts every year every age group starting after 
source morgan stanley research calculations 
participation rate scenarios abenomics has given significant attention raising 
participation rates one the early key performance indicators was raise the labor 
participation rate women aged from between and 
this translates into rate pts per year for the almost elderly the kpi was 
raise the labor participation rate the age group from about pts per year note however several points there were targets for those the 
age groups where the changes would have the most impact participation rates 
for women the age groups have already risen lot for example between 
and the participation rate for women aged rose from 
pts per year the rate exceeded that for comparably aged women the 
united states for women the age group the change was from 
see progress kpis for promoting activity elderly and women japanese 
http kantei singi keizaisaisei jjkaigou sankou pdf 
light the already high participation rates most age groups felt that 
reasonable scenario would rise pts per year all age groups between 
and since very few people work beyond age did not extend the working age 
above this age the results this scenario are seen the same total 
income still falls about the absence wage increases across the board rise 
participation rates pts per year every year until would needed 
stabilize employment income for age groups that have participation rates above 
already prime age males the participation rates would have rise above 
since that would impossible the corresponding increases would have come from 
other groups highly unlikely 
there qualitative lesson here while helpful efforts raise participation rates will 
quickly run into diminishing returns beyond current policies effort may better 
spent elsewhere 
wage growth scenarios what about shifting the age wage profile would this more 
effective than shifting the participation profile the numbers speak for themselves 
already average compensation per hour japan rising year the entire wage 
profile were continue rising this pace total income would rise about 
the pace about year all wages are rising why would income rise 
only because the number people receiving the wages the labor force 
falling 
there another interesting aspect successful wage growth policies they make 
participation policies more effective when wage growth rise participation 
growth from pts pts raises income only about however 
when wage growth the same rise participation growth improves income 
the qualitative lesson from this scenario also clear the most effective way offset 
the adverse demographics obtain high wage growth 
consumption how will react income changes 
despite significant growth employment income consumption growth has been quite 
weak for the last two years indeed real employment income grew and 
respectively and but consumption growth was and one 
the most common explanations that japanese consumption has switched from 
keynesian based year year income modigliani based lifetime income 
the keynesian model easy when income rises consumption rises proportionally the 
lifetime income model harder the lifetime income model consumption smoothed 
over the course one entire life even though income earned only working years 
according this theory the elderly are not spending because longer longevity requires 
splitting lifetime income which they have already received cover more years 
especially years when people can longer work for the young the problem doubly 
difficult the young face not only longer lives but also diminished wage prospects they 
have less total income spread over more years course their consumption will 
weak 
the statistical evidence does not give conclusive support either theory 
consumption for the keynesian theory the evidence exhibit the axes show the 
natural logarithms real employment income horizontal and real consumption 
vertical annual data from base year gdp are available from those 
from the base year are available only moreover the latter period was 
disrupted the financial crisis and reading consumption relationships 
from these data may hard since the base series short and disrupted used 
the base series calculate two trend lines for and both 
periods show real consumption growth rise almost exactly for with real income 
growth thus the weakness consumption would have attributed 
special factors such the fluctuations oil prices the impact the 
consumption tax hike

for the lifetime income approach the evidence exhibit this exhibit uses the gdp data and also compares the logarithm real employment income that 
real consumption there clear deceleration the trend this deceleration can 
seen evidence that the one for one relationship consumption income may 
breaking down and thus that lifetime income factors may more important moreover 
the relationship consumption lifetime income inherently has strong inertia thus 
when there are changes income prospects the changes consumption may surface 
only over longer periods time that said the variation real income has been quite 
small during the period and large disturbances have been frequent 
may hard discern whether the evidence from these years really supports the 
lifetime income approach consumption

looking the next issue how translate the income scenarios into 
consumption paths for the keynesian consumption scenario simply take the growth 
rate income and apply the consumption equation implied exhibit above which 
showed near relationship log employment income log consumption 
predictably the results show wide splay just income does see exhibit 
exhibit keynesian consumption scenarios based the wage and participation profile 
scenarios 
source morgan stanley research calculations 
contrast the results from the modigliani model are more nuanced these results 
occur because the far more complex nature how this model translates income into 
consumption this model high past income keeps future consumption high well 
hence for older cohorts the income gains earlier years are still impacting 
consumption out particular the scenarios with zero wage growth the 
boomer juniors will still have rising earnings for another decade and these earnings will 
sustain consumption until about the graph shows however the pace 
consumption growth these scenarios wanes toward and thus the post 
prospects are not good 
exhibit modigliani consumption scenarios based the wage and participation profile 
scenarios 
source morgan stanley research calculations 
also interesting compare the keynes and modigliani consumption patterns the 
best and worst income scenarios the worst scenario the paths are very different the 
inertia modigliani consumption prevents drop consumption while the keynesian 
path shows collapse the best scenario however consumption broadly the same 
exhibit comparing keynes and modigliani scenarios
