committee proposals from march suggests that the 
reforms will far from sufficient achieve abenomics goals 
this outcome was the result three factors attention japan matters 
became far more important after the presidential election leaving less time 
focus labor reform the osaka school incident distracted attention 
the committee insistence broad consensus gave inordinate power forces 
hostile labor reform 
going forward macro labor news will focus whether the official labor policy 
commission adopts the measures proposed the latest report however the 
micro news probably more important even with sluggish macro labor policy 
labor market tightness will trigger market driven change labor practices

work style reform report major disappointment 
labor reform crucial element abenomics the long awaited march proposals 
the work style reform committee formed the centerpiece this initiative our 
report march proposed scorecard for evaluating whether the reform 
proposals would spur productivity gains income and real growth 
despite some progress some areas cannot give overall grade better than 
see exhibit the good news came the emphasis disclosure wage information 
that markets can work better some the goals and targets were excellent such 
enhancing productivity wages and growth and shifting from focus regular 
non regular workers focus equal pay for equal work however these goals 
were diluted addition many other goals such mental health reducing hours 
ending work related suicides while important from social view point conflating 
these latter goals with macro productivity only reduces the ability address any 
the devils are the details implementation timing and methods 
adoption blanket rule for overtime hours meant reduce total hours 
worked the proposed rules will create inefficiencies the micro level and exacerbate 
the labor shortage moreover the proposal was based agreement big business 
and big labor which represent only about the work force 
there little attention the impact shorter hours total income 
there heavy reliance administrative enforcement increasingly labor short 
economy the likely result will lower efficiency implementation and lower 
transparency 
the content and timelines for many new measures are opaque increased uncertainty 
may lower transparency and efficiency 
there estimate the budgetary cost proposed measures despite the strong 
emphasis administrative enforcement 
the rules not apply civil servants that the consequences the rules will 
not felt the people who make and enforce them 
the pace introduction unskilled foreign labor extremely slow 
there mention whatsoever monetary compensation for dismissal perhaps 
the most important item that would improve labor market liquidity and raise efficiency 
measures increased participation elderly workers are mostly platitudes 
japan economics will labor reform succeed mar 
data from the ministry health labor and welfare showed claims for 
compensation for deaths from work related factors called overwork deaths 
these compensation was paid cases see mhlw 
http mhlw stf houdou heisei announcement the 
state overwork deaths and labor compensation june this total compares 
with traffic deaths and murders 
the scorecard work style reform our view 
exhibit our scorecard work style reform 
scorecard item from our march report 
content comment 
are the purposes hkk primarily economic raising productivity 
wages income and consumption 
some the stated macro goals eliminating the regular non regular 
distinction raising overall labor productivity are excellent but the specific 
measures and time lines are inadequate achieve the stated goals moreover 
many measures such mental health care while important are not central 
the labor reform debate 
how much specificity will new rules require disclosure wage 
scales way reduce the asymmetry information between 
business and labor 
the report emphasizes disclosure way ensure equal pay for equal work 
disclosure powerful weapon but there only low specificity how 
disclosure will work how will accessed that said good idea have 
national databases pay scales and jobs 
what the timeline for elimination the distinction between regular 
and non regular workers will indefinite unwritten contracts for regular 
workers eliminated 
excellent goal but deadlines mention eliminating unlimited contracts 
but there desire make pay comparable without reference contract length 
mention this crucial element there mention expedited non judicial 
arbitration for labor disputes unfair dismissal however the flexibility labor 
markets will not likely rise much result labor intensive time intensive 
arbitration procedures 
blanket rules moreover the rules were decided big labor and big business 
the interests small business and non union labor were not adequately 
represented and the rules could backfire raising burdens small business 
the treatment exceptions remains subject much arbitrary interpretation and 
hence opens the door back room deals 
guidance however the importance maintaining income order support 
the economy least mentioned 
there section the report encouraging higher participation elderly 
workers but specific measures healthcare contributions anything else 
will the reforms include clear standards for monetary compensation 
for dismissal least requirement that such compensation 
specified labor contracts 
will the new rules overtime hours blanket rules applied all 
firms will determination rules left firms workers but with 
mandatory disclosure 
will there clear guidance maintaining total income labor 
even hours are cut who will reap the gains for productivity 
improvement labor business 
will the healthcare contributions firms behalf older workers 
reduced that the burden hiring lowered such workers 
would have bear more their own healthcare contributions 
will the door for less skilled foreign labor opened wider and 
what timeline 
what will the fiscal costs and regulatory burdens the new labor 
system will the system raise lower productivity after such costs 
and burdens 
will the new rules applied equally public sector workers and 
private sector workers 
average grade 
the potential for such change mentioned but pace will very slow that 
said the government gets easing permanent residence conditions for 
highly skilled workers 
mention and sense how the bureaucratic burden will impacted 
new systems ability implement new initiatives highly questionable big 
government approach 
mention inclusion civil servants the overtime other rules that will 
applied the private sector 
source morgan stanley research 
economics will drive micro reforms 
although major disappointment the report does not change the reality the labor 
shortage that shortage itself driving higher wages and labor reforms the micro 
level private sector firms are already changing labor rules and practices light the 
difficulty attracting workers financial markets pressures the labor market 
are key driver microeconomic innovation and regulatory change indeed the 
disappointing content the work style reform committee report only means that the 
benefit micro innovation labor practices higher think prudent therefore 
for investors pay more attention labor policies and practices individual firms 
and thus gauge whether labor practices are becoming differentiating competitive 
advantage
