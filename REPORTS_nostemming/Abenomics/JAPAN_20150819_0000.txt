insight autumn agenda how much 
capex does abenomics need 
achieving the real growth rate target abenomics will require 
much higher growth rates capex than now seem likely thus the 
key item the autumn policy agenda will tax regulation and 
governance reforms spur more and more productive capex 
capex history trend and forecast 
investor skepticism about abenomics rising because the government 
focus national security has diluted its focus economics think that 
focus will return economics october once the security debate subsides 
the autumn economics debate shifting toward business investment 
capex for two reasons aging means that the population shrinks but 
the labor force shrinks faster the labor force shrinks sustaining living 
standards requires ever higher productivity ever higher productivity requires 
more and better capex higher capex needed offset the negative 
demand impact fiscal consolidation 
capex japan recovering but not fast enough foresee capex 
growing about trl growth pace about good 
news this pace exceeds the year trend only bad news the 
pace falls far below that needed achieve the real gdp growth 
target indeed even with faster productivity growth the gdp growth target 
would require capex growth more than trl year 
another significant round regulatory tax and corporate 
incentive changes will likely necessary before japan combination 
capex growth productivity growth and labor force growth can 
combine achieve the abenomics growth target 
thus the key autumn policy issue will capex incentives already the 
focus corporate governance has bolstered micro incentives for better capex 
key themes will include labor substitution through especially small 
firms and public sector efficiency key industries will include energy 
healthcare agriculture distribution construction hospitality 
and transportation

capex productivity tradeoff with different 
employment growth levels 
note the circle the upper left shows that about trl 
capex would needed employment falls 
year and tfp growth stays the recent level 
the circle the lower right shows that about trl capex 
would needed employment remains stable and 
tfp growth rises extremely challenging

still complacency 
japanese economic policy remains stuck the complacency phase the cric cycle the stock market has 
remained high over the last few months and earnings have continued improve while welcome these 
developments have dark side they dull the edge economic reform policy there have been several 
disappointments recently the growth strategy and the fiscal economic strategy june were long rhetoric 
and short details japan economics fiscal economic reform plan disappointing jul 
moreover the electoral reform plan for the upper house key milestone changing the political incentives 
that determine economic policy was disappointing japan economics upper house election reform 
another disappointment for abenomics jul 
investors are concerned that this phase could extend further light the intense focus the abe government 
national security matters indeed some recent policy blunders such the huge budget requested for the 
new national stadium could have been avoided with more attention from the pm office going forward there 
are worries that abe may not able recoup the recent declines his support ratio and thus lose the 
ability promote further economic reforms see japan economics the drop the cabinet support rate 
threat abenomics aug 
think such concerns are misdirected the national security debate will settled end september when 
the current diet session expires focus will likely return economic issues because these are the issues that are 
closest the concerns most voters moreover with the upper house election looming summer the 
incentive focus the economy will strengthen 
rather the more legitimate worry concerns the content economic policy the supply side very large 
acceleration productivity growth will needed the growth target reached the face 
falling labor force the rhetoric abenomics has focused productivity growth and significant progress has 
been made some areas however the sources productivity growth are not well understood and 
unclear whether large acceleration productivity possible how might achieved 
there demand side issue well the government committed achieving primary fiscal balance 
even with high economic growth extra adjustment about gdp will needed fiscal 
consolidation subtracts this amount private demand will have make the difference what components 
private demand might provide such demand 
one candidate private consumption however there seems only low likelihood rise consumption that 
related income growth true fiscal cuts may spur private spending health sick care formerly paid 
the government but the increment private spending likely less than the cuts individuals are likely 
more cost conscious 
another candidate agricultural exports however foodstuff exports were only trl order 
reach even trl the growth rate would have saar another tourism however the rise 
from about trl receipts per year prior nearly trl annualized has already been huge extra 
tourism offset extra fiscal consolidation may insufficient finally global growth could rebound however 
the japanese government has ability control global growth 
which leaves capex the crucial point that capex aids both the supply and demand sides the economy thus 
increased capex kills two birds with one stone will raise demand and productivity the same time next 
look the recent history capex japan and then calculate from simple supply side model how much 
extra capex and technology acceleration would needed order reach gdp growth the face 
demographic headwinds

japanese capex recent history 
very short history aggregate japanese capex presented exhibit the bubble economy period saw real 
capex prices rise from just trl gdp trl the excess investment 
this period was key reason for the deflationary pressures the early quite apart from the bursting 
the equity bubble capex had dropped back trl gdp 
after new trend emerged while stop macro policies created two cycles the the trend was 
firmly moderately upward the koizumi reforms and global economic recovery the created new 
boom and the post lehman crisis economy bust however the post trend seemed remain intact 
most recently since the trough early capex has grown average pace far above the post 
trend indeed about saar see exhibit the break above the trend likely genuine even 
capex falls somewhat below the line there pattern higher highs and higher lows moreover there some 
evidence that the recent rise return assets roa becoming structural exhibit shows the excess roa

how much capex does abenomics need approach assume tfp 
growth derive capex 
capex trl lot but enough the obvious question enough for what the answer enough 
reach the abenomics real growth goal and how much capex that answer this question with two 
approaches both based growth theory 
the first approach starts with the very convenient theoretical identity from growth theory from the supply side 
the growth rate gdp has three determinants the growth rates employment the capital stock and 
total factor productivity the first two growth rates have parameters attached reflecting their impact gdp 
while the growth total factor productivity has implicit coefficient that 
tfp 
where the growth rate gdp the growth employment the growth the capital stock and 
tfp the growth total factor productivity see appendix for the full model this first approach 
assume growth rate tfp and then derive the extra capital stock needed reach gdp growth the 
basis demographic assumptions about the labor force from the required capital stock generate required 
investment based historical average depreciation rates 
exhibit the tradeoff between productivity 
growth and capex required for real growth 
have calculated that the average value for tfp 
the period was exhibit shows 
this level tfp growth capex would have 
trl point the employment indeed falls 
about per year even employment were flat 
capex would have reach about trl 
these capex levels are astronomical and highly 
unrealistic thus tfp growth remains 
real gdp growth unlikely achievable 
fortunately abenomics growth strategy understands 
this point extremely well indeed the recent fiscal and 
economic growth strategy called thick boned 
policy june emphasized the point very 
strongly how much capex would needed different 
levels productivity growth exhibit gives the 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
answer employment falls year upper line 
the exhibit but tfp growth were the horizontal axis then capex would have grow about trl 
employment were stable lower line the exhibit then capex could low trl 
japan economics august 
exhibit translates the results above into average capex 
growth rates from employment falls 
year upper line the exhibit tfp growth rate 
only implies compounded capex growth rate 
per year order achieve the growth target 
contrast with employment stable and tfp growth 
year lower line the exhibit then the capex 
growth rate could low 
exhibit tfp growth and capex growth 
required for real growth 
the qualitative message these scenarios the 
important part even with significant tfp growth 
capex growth will have significantly higher 
japan reach sustainable growth rate 
however these calculations have one important 
weakness they merely assume growth rate tfp 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
based best estimate how successful abenomics 
will and then derive the required capex growth rate 
they not actually model how tfp growth determined more specified approach addresses this issue 
the document says order 
raise japan potential growth rate necessary raise productivity 
strengthen the supply side and aggressively create demand new markets order achieve dramatic 
increase productivity the key elements are spurring energy saving and investments expanded 
investment intellectual capital such human capital investment and investment this investment will 
bring new ideas and methods with unceasing innovation which new value creation through creativity see 
basic policies for economic fiscal management and reform keizai zaisei unei kaikaku kihon 
hoshin tsuite cabinet office june the document was adopted the cabinet the day 
publication 
japan economics august 
how much capex does abenomics need approach assume capex 
growth derive tfp 
the second approach also uses the growth theory framework but applied somewhat different way this 
second approach assumes rate capex growth then derives both the rate tfp growth and the rate 
capital stock growth the latter are then used calculate gdp growth short given assumption 
employment growth the capex growth rate the control variable that adjusted achieve gdp growth 
exhibit illustrates for example employment growth were then capex growth would have 
order reach gdp growth employment growth were positive then less capex growth would needed 
contrast the more negative employment growth becomes the higher the needed capex growth the 
baseline case employment shrinkage then capex growth would have year order for 
growth average from 
exhibit approach capex growth needed with different employment growth assumptions 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
these scenarios have the same qualitative message the model the first approach capex growth 
will have significantly higher japan reach sustainable growth rate 
these calculations assume linear 
relationship between capex growth and tfp growth the sample period for 
the calculation this relationship coefficients from the sample period were used 
the required capex growth rate would somewhat higher

the lotus flower can grow from mud 
are capex levels trl per year tfp growth even within the realm possibility think that 
the answer yes even though much effort would needed 
exhibit shows many japanese industries have labor productivity real output per worker levels that 
are far below counterpart industries the weighted value added shown the thickness each bar 
average labor productivity japan would about compared level all the japanese 
industries below their counterparts raised productivity levels the japanese average would rise 
the increase from would rise about even with long catch period years closing 
the gap would add compounded pts japanese labor productivity growth this would top the 
approximately achieved average over the last years

what measures are needed achieve the faster tfp 
growth think that the agenda comes down the 
ten elements structural reform that have 
identified essential for abenomics see exhibit 
significant progress has been made some areas 
already such corporate governance and agriculture 
important progress has been made others such 
government reform education and tax reform 
however much more work needed order lower 
energy costs make labor markets more flexible 
allowing monetary compensation for dismissal and 
immigration key area that often overlooked 
electoral reform without changed incentive for diet 
members their power resist vested interests will 
remain weak 
course important not confuse the two types 
productivity the labor productivity used exhibit 
typically exceeds the total factor productivity the 
period labor productivity growth averaged 
about and tfp growth see appendix 
this differential were hold and annual labor 
productivity growth indeed were accelerate 
the tfp growth would far above the needed 
hold capex needs near recent levels 
whether such labor productivity and total factor 
productivity growth actually occurs different matter 
suggested our capex forecasts above think the 
answer not yet 
exhibit what needed accelerate tfp 
rce rgan stan ley research 
see japan economics insight energy long trek the best mix mar 
japan economics august 
and what industries stand gain the most with successful acceleration tfp one key element the ability 
cut labor costs through higher capital intensity exhibit shows that for virtually every industry the ratio 
labor costs the cost goods sold lcr higher for small firms this suggests that small firms could benefit 
from increased investment virtually every industry addition some industries stand out with extremely 
high lcrs among these are medical welfare lodging education and restaurants except for restaurants these 
are industries where the gap between large firm lcrs and non large firm lcrs particularly large 
exhibit ratio labor costs the cost goods sold

short another significant round regulatory tax and corporate incentive changes will likely 
necessary before japan combination capex growth tfp growth and labor force growth can 
combine reach the abenomics growth target 
japan economics august 
appendix capex simple growth models 
this appendix presents the simple growth models used for the calculations the text 
the first model takes the growth rate tfp exogenous and looks the requirements for capex light 
exogenous labor force growth the model presented exhibit start with the very convenient 
theoretical identity from growth theory the growth rate gdp has three determinants the growth rates 
employment the capital stock and total factor productivity equation the first two growth rates have 
parameters attached reflecting their impact gdp while the growth total factor productivity has implicit 
coefficient 
exhibit model assume tfp growth and derive capex 
rce rgan stan ley research 
the next step connect growth the capital stock investment this easy seen equation where 
investment and the rate depreciation easy derive value for substitute into and solve 
for the harder part specifying values for and tfp but even this not too hard 
the derivation the change the capital stock equals gross investment minus depreciation 
divide through defined and the capital stock the previous time period and this becomes the text 
for and economic theory comes handy common and plausible assumption that this 
implies that doubling both labor and capital will double output economics jargon constant returns 
scale furthermore and are widely interpreted the income shares labor and capital the stylized fact 
from the growth theory that and the baseline scenario use these values 
the rate depreciation can estimated from actual data have data for the growth rate the capital stock 
for the level capital and for investment using data for derived the average value for 
the rate depreciation the baseline scenario round this 
japan economics august 
finally need value for tfp deriving historical rate for tfp also straightforward just use equation 
know and and have assumptions for and using these values the geometric average value 
for tfp the period 
with these values specified all need assume demographic scenario for employment growth and 
then see what different values tfp mean for required capex for example tfp growth were and 
employment growth then capex would have rise trl shown exhibit this target 
implies average growth rate year for capex order reach real gdp growth 
exhibit scenario results from model exogenous tfp growth 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
another key assumption this model constant returns scale the common assumption growth theory 
that doubling the inputs the production function will double the output the model above this idea 
expressed the simple relationship that however recent conundrum global growth that very 
low levels investment investments can bring extremely high increases output even with fewer 
workers this phenomenon raises the possibility increasing returns scale that especially 
japan economics august 
since the responsiveness real growth capital stock growth very high how would such phenomenon 
impact the required capex hit real growth exhibit has the calculation 
this first model the level capex 
needed reach growth trl however the 
table shows very high figure then 
required capex would only trl about the 
same our forecast for the current year 
exhibit the impact increasing returns 
scale needed investment 
economies scale 
tfp 
required 
investment 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
approach 
the second growth model starts with the same growth identity tfp but uses different 
logic for the relationship capex growth exhibit this second model the growth rate capex 
exogenous the growth rate capex then generates growth rates capital stock and tfp when these are put 
together wthey generate the gdp growth rate with exogenous rate employment growth the 
background the result tradeoff line between the background growth rate employment and the 
corresponding required growth rate capex which determines both capital stock growth and tfp growth 
needed reach real growth for example employment growth then capex growth must 
order bring tfp growth and capital stock growth sufficient reach gdp growth 
specifically start again with equation above 
tfp 
but then model tfp growth function capex growth 
tfp capex 
the assumed capex growth implies growth rate the capital stock and growth rate tfp with 
demographic assumption employment growth can then use equation calculate real gdp growth 
rate that the growth rate capex leads through this logic determine the growth rate gdp with 
different assumption labor force growth different growth rate capex generates different growth rate 
for gdp then turn the calculation its head since the relationship between capex growth and gdp growth 
one one can take target gdp growth rate and assumed employment growth rate and then 
reverse calculate the required rate capex growth the model given exhibit

exhibit model assume capex and derive tfp

equations and form system the unknowns this system are capex and assume values for 
and the value predetermined for have target thus matrix terms this becomes 
and the solution 
note that the term will change over time different levels capex are implemented that the solution 
for the current period only order get solutions for future periods one must update the coefficient matrix 
each period 
for equation have estimated coefficients and and included them with the following stylized facts 
the results this simulation are below see exhibit with the assumptions listed the simulation results 
require capex growth order average real growth between the result this
