the government has released its macro policies and budget for 
the key goal higher productivity are the 
measures sufficient reach the goal are skeptical 
the policy proposals december focus clearly the key issues facing 
japanese growth particular the policy emphasis the need for productivity 
growth encouraging setting target for the business investment needed 
achieve the productivity growth also encouraging 
the problems will come the implementation even the policy document the 
timelines and scope for number key policies remain ambiguous moreover 
the budget does not appear have the strong measures needed 
either spending tax reform achieve the goals stated the policy 
document 
thus stick with our long held view abenomics trust but verify the 
difference this point that are five years into the program and there 
that much less time for bold measures implemented close attention will 
warranted many specific items there much verify 
exhibit the challenge can new economic policies accelerate investment and 
raise productivity enough offset the impact demographics 
employment 
note the amount implied demographics means that the population falls from the share follows the longterm trend from and the ratio employment the population follows the long term trend from overall 
these changes take employment from mln mln note that employment was mln

the problem not enough labor capital productivity 
see japan economic outlook gradual exit from 
deflation takeshi yamaguchi and shoki omori november 
from the supply side gdp the product productivity 
and employment convert this equation 
growth rates and becomes thus the 
growth rate gdp equals the sum the growth rates 
simple labor productivity and employment 
end october there were about mln 
foreign workers japan the year that date the 
increase was relative japan past this very 
substantial number however relative total employment 
now mln small number 
when abenomics started early there were two 
overriding goals end deflation and achieve real growth 
there has been substantial progress the first and 
prospects for achieving this goal are good however real 
gdp growth while good recent japanese standards 
has fallen somewhat short the goal over the nearly 
five years abenomics real gdp has risen cumulative 
total touch under the problem that 
the sources this growth are unsustainable using the 
supply side breakdown this points real gdp 
growth comprised pts from the increase 
employment and pts from labor productivity exhibit 
light demographics and the low level likely 
immigration the composition future gdp growth will 
have shift toward productivity the growth target 
reached the key issue for investors whether economic 
policies accelerate labor productivity enough 
exhibit cumulative changes since end from labor from productivity 
cumulative change from dec 
since the start abenomics real 
gdp has risen this pts 
came from employment the other pts

key reason for skepticism the path labor productivity seen exhibit true labor 
productivity cumulative since the start abenomics that said there are 
two problems first the rise was achieved over years rather slow pace 
second most the improvement occurred the first year due cyclical recovery 
since early labor productivity has been largely stagnant why 
the answer found adding capital the calculation the key insight labor 
productivity can restated the product capital productivity output 
per unit capital and capital intensity capital per worker with this breakdown 
the challenge facing abenomics becomes clearer exhibit 
the recent history labor productivity japan has three periods from 
labor productivity rose because capital intensity rose faster than capital 
productivity fell that japan made for deteriorating usage capital increasing 
the quantity even more from labor productivity rose but for 
different reasons due part the clean the financial system capital efficiency 
began improve but capital intensity flattened since the global financial crisis 
even though capital efficiency continues rise capital intensity has fallen short 
labor productivity has stagnated because investment has been weak this fact 
naturally raises the question how much investment must rise order raise 
productivity growth enough

tsuite the new economic package december 
this result presumes that hours per worker fall about 
which line with the goals work style reform and 
with the increased share elderly the workforce output 
per worker rising even while hours per worker are 
falling then output per hour must rise 
the government new economic package from december 
sets clear targets for productivity growth and 
investment growth the package aims double the 
growth gdp per hour worked from per year and targets investment 
above that believe that this scenario 
generally consistent see exhibit middle column for 
rise investment from

employment ratio and the participation ratio while the population forecast came from the ministry internal affairs and communications official 
forecast then derived the required investment from the capital stock required each scenario assuming the historical rate depreciation 
calculated from the trend the new gdp statistics assume that hours per employee fall year due the impact work style reforms and 
increased use part time and older workers 
sources data for from cabinet office national accounts population data from ministry internal affairs and communications scenarios for 
from morgan stanley research 
note however that achieving the initial abenomics goal real gdp growth would 
require growth investment about per year right hand column thus even 
the new package hits the investment target would not achieve the initial real gdp 
growth target 
will the policies bring enough investment 
the first element policies was announced december this new package 
contains two parts people revolution hitozukuri kakumei and productivity 
revolution seisansei kakumei the focus the former supporting labor force 
participation women improving early education higher education for students 
from low income families and support for families taking care elderly parents 
moreover the measures are not only subsidies but also include supply side elements 
such better pay for child care and nursing care workers these are all laudable goals 
and are important for labor force participation 
however the new package not specific the budget support needed achieve 
meaningful improvements moreover spending for several these initiatives 
postponed until the scheduled consumption tax hike the spending only starts 
when the revenue starts although this timing may correct from the viewpoint 
fiscal prudence questionable whether long term goals for can achieved 
the spending for them begins only moreover the document describing the new 
package includes several instances new committees being formed order flesh 
out details how the people revolution will implemented delays are possible 
cit 
the productivity revolution more ambitious indeed the document states that 
japan will marshal all policies toward the goal realizing the great goal 
productivity revolution ahead other nations indeed the contents 
the policy seem promising see exhibit 
exhibit new economic measures contents the productivity revolution 
small business measures 
investment and wage increase promotion for medium and small firms 
concentrated support for finding new management for retiring business owners 
productivity revolution through higher profitability and investment promotion 
accelerating wage hikes machinery and people investments 
corporate governance etc 
productivity revolution through society and disruptive innovation 
systematizing the regulatory sandbox 
systemic reform sectors with lagging productivity 
thorough strengthening the foundation for promotion innovation 
infrastructure for society 
source cabinet office atarashii keizai seisaku pakkeeji tsuite the new economic package december 
looking through the many details see the package mixed bag among the 
encouraging items one for small firms the new policy proposes tax cuts including 
cuts the fixed asset tax for businesses that raise wages train workers and adopt 
advanced technology the target reach about million small firms about 
the total also proposes that patent fees paid small firms cut half another 
proposal supports initiative for small firms that would disappear current 
managers were retire without successors 
for all firms the new package proposes decisive cuts effective tax rates worldbeating levels for firms that raise wages and productivity intriguingly this 
carrot comes with stick the next sentence the paper says will formulate tax 
measures promote decisive management decisions companies that are passive 
about new investments and wage hikes even with record high corporate profits 
the section society there broad set proposals among those 
mentioned are 
more aggressive use special economic zones regulatory sandboxes 
changes the agricultural land law 
starting line medical systems and perhaps linking them the 
current mynumber national system 
national database public works projects 
better cooperation among business academia and bureaucrats innovation 
database interoperability among different public and private databases 
more aggressive actions abandoned property disposal 
hour business establishment procedures 
explicit mention the need for monetary compensation for unfair dismissal the 
lack which has been major barrier labor reform 
these ideas are intriguing but many cases the package says that legislation will 
introduced the next regular session the diet 
with this mixed bag investors are likely our view skeptical the past 
despite strong commitments and good ideas number proposals have been stymied 
for years the integrated resorts bill comes mind close attention will warranted 
the many specific items 
see ministry agriculture forestry 
and fisheries 
http maff tokei sihyo data 
the other source skepticism about the package the extent the impact even 
the ideas are good and even the implementation good the result may not bring 
much investment hoped for example the section agricultural reform the 
new package proposes law for the next diet session change the agricultural 
land law order promote the agricultural use agricultural lands for which 
the successors are not registered the need clear the average age farmers 
nationwide many retiring farmers wish sell their land but have great 
trouble doing because the agricultural land laws however the very modest 
nature the proposal the new package suggests that agricultural productivity 
may not rise much even the proposed revisions are adopted 
short the package includes many good ideas but implementation will likely remain 
key question for investors moreover doubt that investors will patient 
earlier years abenomics this context the newly proposed budget for 
which was announced end december important does the new budget put 
significant funding behind the new policies the december economic package 
the budget modest changes only 
the fiscal system japan just complicated 
other countries hence overall trends government spending 
and revenue are not always visible the figures for the 
central government alone and even the central government 
has both general account and number special accounts 
which are related complex ways for description how 
the japanese system works see feldman robert japan

overview the new budget presented exhibit 
while this budget covers only the general account the 
central government does give good sense 
spending priorities the budget overall spending 
only bond expenses and revenue transfers

policy spending increases line with the priorities set out 
the december package not really the increase 
policy spending fully was social spending next 
came defense with bln education and science got net 
increase only bln about mln and public 
works got only bln about mln from these

however sometimes the aggregate numbers can hide major changes within 
categories look the details helps clarify whether this the case for example 
the government explanation the budget outlines elements the drastic 
reform bappon kaikaku medical spending although there increase 
bln doctor fees there are drug price cuts worth bln drug system cuts

similar point can made for the quality improvement elements that the 
government proposes there are number productivity positive programs such 
drone use friendly container terminals ports road improvements 
projects for face recognition for use immigration points rice land use improvements 
increasing the number foreign students japanese universities etc even taken 
together however these quality improvement measures amount only bln 
short there only weak evidence that the spending side the new budget will make 
major progress toward the people revolution and the productivity revolution 
mentioned the december policy proposals what about tax reforms 
the government revenue budget shows total revenue increase about exhibit 
very much line with the assumed growth nominal gdp proceeds 
from the consumption tax grow very much line with nominal gdp but the other key 
elements not individual income tax projected grow about trl rise 
addition growth from overall income this forecast depends part 
proposed cuts income tax exemptions contrast the growth the corporation tax 
the corporate income tax negative this decline however quirk the initial 
corporate tax forecast for was trl mof current revised forecast for

there one more important element tax policy for increases the social 
security contribution rate for pensions will end the tax reform ten plus years ago 
the rate pension contributions split evenly between employer and 
employee was programed rise gradually from with 
corresponding increases other public pensions press release from the ministry 
health labor and welfare august announced welfare pension 
contribution rate hikes have ended the end contribution hikes will welcomed 
both companies and individuals however there also problem without further 
contribution rate increases how will the government finance continued increases 
pension payments the same problem exists for healthcare contribution rates which 
peaked light these tax developments even more attention 
spending control will needed 
conclusion words numbers 
the policy proposals december focus clearly the key issues facing japanese 
growth particular the policy emphasis the need for productivity growth 
encouraging setting target for the business investment needed achieve the 
productivity growth also encouraging 
the problems will come the implementation even the policy document the

thus stick with our long held view abenomics trust but verify the
