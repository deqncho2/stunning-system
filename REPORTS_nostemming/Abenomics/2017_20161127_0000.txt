japan economic outlook 
keep trusting but keep 
verifying 
growth supported fiscal policy and 
global rebound inflation will probably accelerate the yen 
weakens oil stabilizes and wages rise 
growth will supported fiscal policy and global rebound the 
large fiscal package passed october will spent largely and 
extra fiscal support possible the global shift fiscal stimulus will aid japan 
efforts monetary policy will remain highly accommodative but new 
monetary support likely our view structural reform policies are proceeding 
measured pace and there are some signs acceleration see growth 
above and about both higher than potential growth 
about 
expect inflation accelerate and reach near end 
hourly wages now rising about will likely continue accelerate 
demographics constrain labor supply and push the unemployment rate below 
toward moreover the weakening yen and rising energy prices should put 
upward pressures prices there are two major uncertainties first the 
balance between technology that lowers labor demand and demographics that 
lower labor supply second the balance between high and low wage jobs 
the key issue monetary policy will how boj adjusts the yield target 
prices accelerate expect boj leave the year yield target around 
least until core price inflation above which expect only the 
second half thereafter higher core inflation becomes more certain 
boj will likely raise the ceiling the yield target gradually only when prices 
actually near boj likely end nirp only major negative price shock 
could trigger further moves into negative rates 
fiscal policy likely remain accommodative through least 
consumption tax hikes have been postponed until and fiscal spending for 
growth related projects has begun rise after the drop expect 
fiscal deficits slightly higher but well within manageable amounts 
expect modest postponement the primary surplus target but also 
expect the government use political stability focus spending cuts 
there are signs acceleration structural reform policies the political 
background strong light the strong victory the ruling party the july 
upper house election and the landslide victory the pro reform ldp candidate 
the tokyo governor election labor market reform crucial and abe has 
created special commission make proposals end march accelerated 
pace deregulation the would likely hasten pro growth reforms japan 
well that said achieving the abenomics goal real growth even the

labor force shrinks requires productivity growth growth policies far 
are unlikely achieve this bolder and faster action needed areas such 
agriculture energy taxation healthcare and education moreover investors will 
remain skeptical until laws are actually passed implemented and proven 
effective 
growth and inflation risks are balanced the bear case implementation 
fiscal and reform policies faces domestic political hurdles even with stable 
government this case real growth could stall below and core 
prices near the bull case fiscal policy would earlier and more effective 
with wages rising faster and driving consumption and with bit help from 
the global economy 
supplementary explanation regarding our new monetary policy outlook 
raising our cpi forecasts japan monetary policy direction will remain dependent 
the path future inflation one the most important factors that affects our inflation 
forecasts our assumption given the widening differential between japanese and 
interest rates our team now officially anticipates considerable yen depreciation 
against the dollar specifically our team now forecasting that jpy usd will reach 
usd apr jun exhibit 
this global economic outlook have raised our japanese cpi forecasts not only 
reflecting our team new outlook for substantial yen depreciation and the oil 
futures curve but also taking into account our outlook for expansionary fiscal stance 
over the next few years and upward pressure wages amid ongoing structural 
tightness the labor market forecast nearly yoy growth the end boj 
core cpi fresh food and energy and look for increase close the stable 
inflation target yoy end exhibit

monetary policy outlook based these cpi forecasts our outlook for monetary 
policy can summarized below 
year yield target yield curve control expect the boj current year yield 
target around maintained through jul sep that said expect the boj 
start gradually increase its ceiling the year yield target from oct dec 
when expect yoy growth the boj core cpi approach about yoy while 
expect the boj maintain its floor the year yield target around for 
sustained period other words anticipate shift from specific point target 
target band for the year jgb yield with the boj gradually expanding that band 
inflation starts accelerate exhibit expect the boj allow free movement 
actual market year yields long they are within the target band cpi growth 
subsequently moves closer yoy oct dec expect the boj would 
probably remove the target band for year yields that point would also expect 
the boj remove the jgb purchasing guideline about annually from its 
directives when starts raise the year yield ceiling oct dec 
exhibit expect introduction year yield target band our forecast the year yield targets 
source morgan stanley research 
the market generally expects the boj remain committed the pegging long term 
interest rates around until cpi growth remains above yoy stable manner 
however differ our view think there good chance that the boj will raise 
long term interest targets before japanese core cpi growth reaches the inflationovershooting commitment introduced the boj september linked increase 
the monetary base which think loose constraint and enables the boj freely 
adjust its long term rate targets its design nominal long term interest rate targets 
are pegged around while inflation continues accelerate the boj would likely 
start worry that the impact monetary easing terms real interest rates 
nominal interest less expected inflation will greater than needed based our 
forecasts even actual market rates move along the year ceiling outlined above 
real interest rates would remain well negative territory over our forecast horizon 
short term interest rate targets yield curve control with regard short term policy 
rates expect the boj stick with the current negative rate through jul sep 
based our cpi forecasts would look for the elimination the target band 
for year yields oct dec with the boj simultaneously increasing the policy rate 
thus ending its negative interest rate policy 
guidelines for asset purchases for etf purchases think the current pace around 
annually likely continue least until the end gov kuroda term apr 
after that the bank might adjust the pace purchases depending equity price 
trends expect reit purchases will also continue the current pace about 
annually least until apr
