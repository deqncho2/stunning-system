real growth 
can japan achieve long run real growth not think 
that can paradoxically low growth may raise japan 
investment appeal 
key long term goal abenomics has been sustained real growth 
after four years abenomics think that this goal unlikely 
achieved 
our logic gdp the product labor productivity and labor force labor 
productivity trend growth has decelerated and labor force will keep 
falling unless labor productivity accelerates sharply gdp growth 
impossible current policies are not likely accelerate productivity enough 
two approaches the descriptive approach starts with the identity that labor 
productivity equals the product capital efficiency and capital intensity 
historically capital efficiency has slowed more than capital intensity has 
quickened labor productivity growth slower the analytical approach 
based production function which links labor productivity more broadly 
business investment and technology the impact investment has been stable 
but technology has slowed 
achieving gdp growth would require ahistorical mixtures technology 
progress and investment therefore think that growth unlikely 
paradox precisely because low growth japan has attractive investments the 
best ones will break bottlenecks raising quality and quantity 
investment and augmenting labor availability identify industries where 
the opportunity for business investment could substantial 
with apologies schumpeter began his book can capitalism 
survive follows can capitalism survive not think that can but 
this opinion mine like that every other economist who has pronounced 
upon the subject itself completely uninteresting what counts any 
attempt social prognosis not the yes that sums the facts and 
arguments which lead but those facts and arguments themselves 
following schumpeter advice this paper will focus facts and arguments see

introduction four years abenomics far 
four years have passed since the start abenomics when abe returned office 
december the goals are clear exiting deflation and raising real growth 
indeed june the government said aim achieve over the next ten 
years average about nominal gdp growth and about real gdp growth 
see japan revitalization strategy japan back june japanese the 
method comprehensive requiring actions monetary fiscal and growth policies 
performance however has been combination passes fails and incompletes 
monetary policy the action spring purchase trl year jgbs was 
success boj support for the april consumption tax hike was mistake the shift 
trl jgb purchase october was success the shift negative rates 
january was mistake the shift jgb yield targeting september was 
success despite many bumps underlying price movements are longer deflationary 
fiscal policy the spending side has shown two improvements constraining overall 
spending introducing cap the increment social spending the central 
government budget while increasing the share growth oriented spending 
support for higher labor force participation women that said government remains 
very large social spending areas and may hampering attempts efficiency gains 
the tax side has shown similarly mixed bag the reduction the statutory corporate 
tax rate from has helped spur investment have enhanced 
incentives however higher individual tax rates have hampered work incentives 
moreover for foreign workers there have been two adverse developments the exit tax 
and the levying inheritance tax even after repatriation 
growth policy there has also been mixed bag among successes corporate 
governance policies have improved incentives for capital allocation agricultural reforms 
have reduced the influence monopoly power administrative reforms have raised the 
responsiveness bureaucracy policy actions immigration reforms have augmented 
labor supply the middle lie several items such energy reform one hand 
deregulation has enhanced competition the retail level and competition among 
suppliers across hitherto impassible regional barriers the other vested interests still 
retain strong influence over regulatory decisions and have slowed both and 
adoption new more efficient technologies among the failures electoral reform 
two laws meant correct voter disparities were enacted but did virtually nothing 
reduce them the continued silver democracy serves the short term needs the 
elderly but short changes younger citizens with the result slower productivity 
growth 
enough known now take stock the longer term outlook for abenomics has the 
pace far been sufficient achieve the stated goal real growth order 
address this question start with short history productivity growth 
labor productivity has slowed but why 
let start looking the evolution labor productivity defined real output per 
worker symbols has decelerated exhibit indeed the quadratic time trend 
dashed line exhibit suggests that productivity growth may only 
yes basis points logistic time trend suggests solid trend 
exhibit labor productivity 
actual 
logistic trend 
poly actual 
note for the logistic trend curve solid trend line used equation the form exp where productivity function 
time there are three parameters determines the vertical position determines the inflection point and determines the shape chose values 
and minimize the sum the root mean square errors see also japan economics snapshot abenomics fights history jul the 
polynomial trend dashed simple quadratic equation time starting 
source cabinet office ministry internal affairs and communications and morgan stanley research calculations 
however time trends are black boxes they have two major weaknesses there 
explanation why productivity has slowed and extension the trends gives results 
that are not credible the logistic method says that there absolute upper limit 
labor productivity this seems unlikely given technology progress the quadratic 
method worse shows productivity starting fall from and fall 
accelerating rate thereafter indeed were the quadratic trend hold labor productivity 
would fall which seems absurd 
hence must think inside the box need further breakdown labor 
productivity order project where might this two ways first 
descriptive and then analytical 
the logistic curve method uses data from and the polynomial 
quadratic method 
where does labor productivity come from 
sources labor productivity growth are most easily described simple fact labor 
productivity the product capital efficiency and capital intensity that 
multiplying the labor force gives gdp that 
the sixty year history japanese gdp terms these factors 
shown exhibit labor hardly moved capital intensity was 
overwhelmingly the most important factor bit more interesting 
the decline capital efficiency indexed only 
drop one hand such drop normal 
light the well known principle declining marginal returns 
each increment capital produces smaller increment gdp 
that said the drop very large 
exhibit growth contributions 
translated into annual growth rates for real gdp rose 
per year this growth comprised pts from capital 
intensity and pts from labor while capital efficiency 
subtracted pts per year short lower quality capital was 
more than offset higher quantity while labor contributed bit growth

capital intensity 
the story looks different and shows kink when focus 
post data exhibit the historical pattern higher 
intensity lower efficiency continued until the financial crisis 
from until the lehman shock capital 
efficiency stabilized growth came almost entirely from increased 
capital intensity although decelerated this pattern implies that 
the financial crisis changed business attitudes toward 
investments quality became more important and quantity less 
labor 
the lehman shock caused downward shift capital 
efficiency because some capital stock simply became redundant 
moreover after this level change capital efficiency began 
deteriorate again albeit much slower pace than the post lehman shock gdp 
growth derived from higher capital intensity and during the abenomics period from 
increased labor force participation well 
the conclusion from this approach labor productivity slowed because the adverse 
balance changes capital intensity and capital productivity although higher capital 
intensity pushed labor productivity upward lower capital efficiency pushed labor 
productivity downward more 
from description analysis 
while enlightening the descriptive approach labor productivity has two important 
flaws does not allow for any interaction the impact capacity quality and 
intensity and relates only obliquely the three key elements the current 
growth debate labor productivity technology progress and demographics order 
make social prognosis schumpeter words see footnote need 
analytical framework for the why theory how capital efficiency capital 
intensity and labor evolve and interact this can done starting with the concept 
production function then isolating the role labor productivity and technology 
the concept production function simple merely formula map productive 
inputs capital labor output symbols this merely there are three 
hard parts specifying mathematical form for the equation that makes sense 
terms economics finding data represent the variables and using statistical 
methods that are credible linking the data the formula only when all three have 
been done can make credible statements about the speed technological change 
labor productivity 
for the formula use the most transparent one the canonical cobb douglas 
production function but adjusted make technology time dependent that 
where output the initial level technology time the growth rate 
technological progress capital labor and parameter showing the capital 
share income note that the coefficients capital and labor add order 
ensure that there are constant returns scale the production function 
the benefit the cobb douglas form that extremely easy use particularly 
when focusing labor productivity transformed the production function into labor 
productivity terms into 
the implications this approach for labor productivity growth are easy derive take 
natural logs both sides and get 
take the first difference this and get 
fortunately since the change natural log variable very close the 
percentage change that variable the growth rate labor productivity 
exhibit shows the parameter estimates for both the capital share income and 
technological progress the key question whether parameters and changed 
over time the results our estimates are exhibit 
capital share income 
capital income share lhs 
technology rhs 
technology growth rate 
exhibit parameters different regression periods 
look how technology parameter changed over time 
first attempted using quadratic function time however the 
estimation results made little sense more effective method 
was splitting the sample period historical turning points 
the capital share income parameter the period 
when japan was impacted the collapse the bubble economy 
generated negative coefficient for the capital share income 
this period was obviously aberration the other periods 
the estimated capital share income was remarkably similar 
about left hand scale exhibit 
source company data morgan stanley research 
technological progress parameter the pattern here much 
clearer the measured pace technological progress also known total factor 
productivity declined consistently over the estimate periods the most recent 
period the pace has been only per year 
our estimated parameters therefore imply that today 
short raising labor productivity growth requires either substantial sustained 
increases the capital labor ratio accelerating total factor productivity 
growth 
tried two other production function specifications the ces and upper limit 
production function the form where the upper limit 
related the capital stock note this latter function then 
approaches infinity approaches geometrically this function one branch 
inverted transposed hyperbola with asymptote neither alternative production 
function proved tractable enough reach qualitative conclusions and 
concentrated the cobb douglas formulation 
the calculation correct the basis point level for example 
rounded basis point level this differs from from only 
basis point quite close enough for our purposes 
the odd results stem from the weakness long term quadratic trends their power 
becomes overwhelming time goes 
there are several potential reasons for the negative parameter estimate the 
were period when companies kept doing old style projects even though the bubble 
had burst the wake the bubble negative impact capital accumulation 
possible odd old projects especially real estate were completed even though the 
economy had made them non economic the sample period for the calculation 
short and badly disrupted the shocked economy the the capital stock 
series applies the business sector only since the estimates for public sector capital 
stock are poorly measured best the business sector capital stock was most impacted 
the bubble had the current estimate included all the public investment into 
bridges nowhere the estimate might have been even more negative did not 
adjust the capital stock with capital utilization series there are cases when doing 
might helpful argue however that unused factory still factory the 
factory longer usable then should depreciated out the capital stock 
figures the real issue whether the capital stock figures for the business sector are 
fully accurate the odd value the estimated parameter may only indicate larger thanusual measurement problems the underlying data for business sector capital stock 
the 
how much capex needed 
using this approach can calculate how much capex will needed the estimated 
combination parameters order achieve the abenomics goal real growth 
can also tell how much would needed with alternative parameter combinations 
gross terms labor supply likely decline about per year over the next 
decade thus order achieve real gdp growth labor productivity growth 
would have thus 
because have good estimates the path can calculate how much change 
needed given parameter combination and then once know the path 
and the rate depreciation historically about can derive values for 
required investment from the relationship that that required

simplified version this calculation for only and 
derive the what if estimates for required investment exhibit 
with the estimates for and for achieving 
real growth would require about trl private sector 
investment this compares the actual value 
trl 
what combinations parameter and parameter would make 
the current level capex sufficient parameter the share 
capital income stays the current then technology 
progress would have about slower rates 
technological progress would make the required share capital 
rise extreme levels 
could raising the labor force can alternative not think that can labor 
force augmentation while important especially for incorporating new global 
technologies seems extremely unlikely fill the gap 
hence syllogism abenomics about raising productivity growth productivity 
growth about enhancing technology progress and capital intensity therefore 
abenomics about enhancing technology and capital intensity has done 
have discussed this alternative elsewhere domestic labor supply hitting peak 
because demographics and the already high rates labor force participation both 
women and the elderly and what about foreign workers today there are about mln 
foreign workers japan mere real growth until even with faster labor 
productivity growth and increases domestic participation rates would require another 
mln foreign workers for details see feldman robert alan japan economics will 
japan need mln foreign workers achieve growth mar 
has abenomics raised and 
has abenomics done enough achieve within the next few years either higher

medical reform electoral reform which needed change the incentives that diet 
members face when making fiscal decisions has failed moreover the recent report 
from the work style reform committee major disappointment crucial area 
this basis cannot reasonably conclude that technological progress will accelerate 
enough that business investment will rise enough achieve growth 
paradox japan remains extremely interesting investment 
target 
capital efficiency key factor when looking for good investments using the 
framework above search through industry data from the ministry finance 
corporate statistics and identify industries where capital efficiency high and where 
not the best opportunities may lie the industries where capital efficiency worst 
because these industries are the most ripe for reform 
the approach illustrated exhibit using data for the horizontal axis shows 
capital intensity industries with high capital intensity are the right and low capital 
intensity the left the vertical axis shows capital efficiency defined the ratio 
operating profit capital each industry shown combination capital intensity 
and capital efficiency 
how judge the performance each industry compare each industry 
standard defined labor productivity the dashed line shows the combinations 
capital efficiency and intensity that would generate average labor productivity 
that since the dashed lines show combinations and that 
generate the all sector average value the solid line shows combinations 
that generate labor productivity that above the all sector average

some good many bad the exhibit shows that very small number industries 
outperform and large number underperform numerical details are exhibit for 
example the petroleum industry has already exceeded all sector labor productivity 
further increases capital efficiency are needed there may other problems 
this industry but low average labor productivity not one note however that the 
employment industries where labor productivity exceeds the average only 
the total other words employment industries where labor productivity 
exceeds the average and industries where falls below average 
some industries not have that much more for example the ceramics 
industry reaching the all sector average for labor productivity would require rise 
capital efficiency only however most other industries have much more 
increase capital efficiency times would necessary merely achieve 
average labor productivity restaurants education and marine transport 
unfortunately achieving the average labor productivity levels not good 
enough stabilize long term living standards higher average labor productivity 
needed the goal raise labor productivity above the level the work gets 
much harder even the electric machinery industry capital efficiency would have 
rise order achieve this goal 
exhibit required improvements capital efficiency reach labor productivity targets

there are two takeaways for investment strategy first order for japan hit labor 
productivity goals needed for abenomics virtually every industry needs improve 
capital efficiency where the needs are greatest medical personal services restaurants 
education and marine transport the investment benefits could greatest second 
even large capital efficiency improvements will not sufficient many industries 
capital deepening will needed well these industries the opportunity for 
business investment could substantial
