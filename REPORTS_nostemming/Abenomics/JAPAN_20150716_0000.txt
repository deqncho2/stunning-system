upper house election reform another 
disappointment for abenomics 
the planned upper house reform unlikely advance fiscal 
sustainability thus upcoming lower house reform plan will have 
exceptionally aggressive order enhance confidence 
abenomics 
upper house disparity ratio under different electoral 
reform systems 
election reform economic issue because election system 
incentives impact economic policy the upper house reform proposed 
the ldp does little advance prospects for fiscal reform for economic 
growth 
the good news that the ldp has reportedly agreed reform plan 
for the upper house reallocate seats from low population prefectures 
toward high population ones introduce merged districts for prefectures 
with small populations the result would reduce the voter disparity ratio vpr 
from based population this plan likely pass during 
the current diet session ahead the upper house election july 
the bad news that this plan unlikely change incentives the 
diet the vpr reduction too small and the silver turnout distortion would 
remain high

the essential impossible the moment 
electoral reform bedrock issue for abenomics sustainable growth requires fiscal reform and fiscal 
reform requires social spending control see japan economics insight second arrow well launched but 
far from target aug however the current electoral system heavily favors regional districts regional 
districts are elderly the elderly oppose social spending cuts thus social spending reform terrifying any 
politician who wants win election result the economically essential politically impossible 
sustainable growth and the current election system are loggerheads 
recent decisions the supreme court have ruled both lower and upper house electoral systems 
state unconstitutionality with upper house election scheduled reforming the upper house 
election system has taken top priority hold another election under the current system might risk supreme 
court ruling that the election was outright unconstitutional even worse invalid since the constitution says 
that the electoral system shall decided law ruling that invalidates such election could prevent 
adoption new election system thus triggering constitutional crisis with this stark prospect the diet has 
taken the matter seriously 
but progress has been snail paced for the lower house the inability reach agreement within the diet 
resulted the formation expert committee design new system january abe 
committed support the committee recommendation when eventually appears see sankei shimbun 
http sankei politics news however details the plan 
have been reported since then indeed has been delayed the deliberations reform the upper house 
since the form the latter will alter the needed reforms the former 
for the upper house deliberations have remained within that and they have been stalled party 
politics since any reform plan will inevitably change the party composition the body the debate has been 
intense and slow however with the upper house election looming and with very little time left 
implement reform plan before then the time for decision came july this year 
the result was peculiar combination the ldp party leadership overrode internal objections ignored the 
demands its own coalition partner and sided with some small opposition parties create down 
plan with two merged districts contrast the ldp coalition partner the komeito decided propose 
joint plan with the main opposition party which would create merged districts however this latter plan has 
essentially chance passing light diet numbers 
thus the question becomes will the down plan change the incentives the diet and make fiscal 
reform more likely judgment this question comes down looking some metrics that may indicate how 
much the system has changed 
the relevant articles state article the term office members the house councilors shall six 
years and election for half the members shall take place every years article electoral districts method 
voting and other matters pertaining the method election members both houses shall fixed 
law see prime minister office

custom neither house participates the reform plans the other once plan determined one 
considered the other house the legislature 
some the ldp were still holding out for 
down plan with merged districts such plan would 
have done even less reduce vprs and was thus not acceptable the ldp leadership

comparison plans 
the down plan has two crucial features would reallocate seats from low population 
prefectures high population ones and introduce merged districts for two sets prefectures with small 
populations the result would reduce the voter disparity ratio vpr from based 
population patterns this progress but leaves the system far from what possible even without merged 
districts 
exhibit compares the current state the seats the upper house districts two alternatives the 
down plan and simple plan that would allocate seats the basis population only with rounding the 
result the latter would reallocation seats the key metrics for comparison are seat reductions 
voter disparity ratios voter disparity score and the silver turnout distortion 
seat reductions neither plan shows progress this because the number seats added high population 
districts equals that subtracted from low population districts the total does not change there have been 
proposals for reduction the number proportional which are single national block and thus have 
voter disparity however reduction proportional seats would worsen equality representation because 
block seats have equality voter weight

how much progress toward voter equality 
the vpr the plan shows some progress however because the calculations used the current plan 
creation the diet are based population the results are already out date using population 
estimates the vpr under the plan would the key interpreting this number see how close 
comes the ideal for this calculation useful use parity progress ratio which just the 
inverse the vpr this ratio shows the percentage perfection achieved system the current system has 
parity progress ratio only the system with current boundaries but strict populationproportional seat allocation down generates progress ratio the plan shows even with some merged districts hence the plan falls far short major progress toward voter equality 
the vpr score improves the vpr the major fault the latter being that the raw vpr takes only the most 
extreme districts measuring inequality and ignores the rest the inequality this score takes the standard 
deviation votes per seat among prefectures and divides the national average the current system has zscore the plan and the plan 
exhibit upper house voter turnout 
age group 
finally comes the thorny issue voter turnout age 
group voter turnout above average for those the 
higher age groups and quite low for those 
the and exhibit this tendency has worsened 
the last few years the young feel ever more 
disenfranchised system that caters the elderly 
order make rough calculation how much voter 
turnout patterns distort the incentives for candidates 
have calculated silver turnout distortion based 
turnout ratios and population shares estimate 
the share elderly votes each prefecture share 
the total votes and allocate the seats that

population the current upper house the silver turnout distortion under the plan this would 
fall and even under the plan only 
short none the plans does much offset the voter turnout advantage the elderly the plan 
represents only small improvement the plan would bring more improvement but would likely remain 
far away from creating the incentives for diet members improve fiscal sustainability indeed the continued 
high levels the silver turnout distortion suggest that any system based current prefectural lines 
would fall short this goal must one give admit that reform impossible and declare defeat not 
necessarily

the ideal system fantasy with practical lessons 
there one hypothetical electoral system that could eliminate voter disparities entirely take the vpr 
without changing single district line merging districts the basic idea adopt the method used 
corporate general shareholders meetings each district would have voting rights the diet proportional the 
population the district for example chamber with seats election district with the 
population would have votes the chamber district with the population would have votes 
addition the number representatives district could entirely independent the number voting 
rights the district the district with votes could decide have only one representative who wielded all 
votes small district could have several representatives although each would have only fraction 
vote more tractable system would likely based rounded voting rights the district for example 
district with voting rights might have representatives but district with voting rights might have 
only representatives 
what would the voter parity metrics look like under such system exhibit gives the answer the first striking 
feature that each upper house vote would require population voters the highest would 
and the lowest would more and less district with population only 
would have voting rights thus this system the vpr would exactly moreover since there 
would deviations among prefectures the standard deviation would exactly short this system 
would bring perfect voter equality

where would the population differences among prefectures show the votes per diet member for 
example with the current seat allocations hyogo prefecture would have seats but voting rights and 
each hyogo diet member would have voting rights contrast tottori prefecture would have seats but 
only voting rights and each diet member would have votes thus the disparity voting rights 
per diet member would for the down system the diet member disparity 
would and for the down system 
interesting note that the diet member disparities under this ideal system are identical the vprs 
above short shift from the current system the ideal system would shift the disparities from voters diet 
members should diet members think that such wide differentials among member voting power disadvantage 
some members diet debate they would free change the number diet members per district and 
correct the disparity among members without creating disparity among voters 
another benefit the ideal system that would allow easier changes diet size one the key obstacles 
reducing the number diet seats has been the adverse impact seat reductions voter disparities the 
smaller the number seats the bigger the rounding errors when seats are allocated and thus the bigger the 
vprs with ideal system such problems vanish voting rights per diet member would adjusted 
automatically for any change diet seats course diet members who might lose their seats 
restructuring the diet would could object unless the plan were delegated independent commission 
however there one aspect this ideal system that far from ideal fails correct the silver turnout 
distortion the reason simple long the turnout rates for the elderly differ from those the population 
whole the distortion will one potential solution this problem mandatory voting such 
australia singapore course june the diet passed low lower the voting age from adding 
about mln new voters the rolls however the likely turnout ratio for these voters unknown and they are 
concentrated urban areas which are underrepresented the diet thus hard think that this change 
voting age will much offset the silver turnout distortion 
see appendix equation

conclusion will investors keep the faith 
have shown that the plan the reform plan most likely adopted would fall short the key 
metrics that would create incentives for fiscal sustainability the more radical plan would also fall 
considerably short even ideal plan would only correct voter disparities but not the silver turnout distortion 
unless mandatory voting were adopted the same time thus must conclude that electoral reform far 
not major step toward increasing fiscal sustainability investor confidence abenomics 
that said there are other elements upcoming electoral reform indeed now that the upper house changes are 
largely decided the expert commission redesign the lower house election system will take the spotlight 
this lower house election reform plan will have exceptionally aggressive order change 
the fiscal policy incentives the diet and thus raise investor confidence abenomics

appendix how calculate the silver turnout distortion 
calculate the silver turnout distortion begin with the simple assertion that the number seats district 
that represents the elderly simply given the share elderly votes multiplied the number seats 
elderly votes district all votes district seats district 
next introduce some definitions note that the voter turnout rate for the elderly 
elderly votes district elderly population district 
and the overall voter turnout overall 
all votes district all population district 
the share the elderly population district 
elderly population district all population district 
using linked ratios equation can restated 
elderly votes district elderly population district 
elderly population district all population district 
all population district all votes district 
seats district 
seats district 
there are data available the prefectural ratios approximate using the national average 
data for are easily available are the number diet seats prefecture 
the overall silver turnout distortion equals the sum across prefectures that 
note that may underestimate the impact elderly voters for two reasons first prefectures with large shares 
the elderly may have higher than average ratios second the relation policy advocated 
candidates the district may non linear even small positive value could trigger large 
focus policies for the elderly
