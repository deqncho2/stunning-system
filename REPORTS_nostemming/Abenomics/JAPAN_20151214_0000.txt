summary 
the current qqe quantitative and qualitative easing framework 
becoming obsolete exit from deflation nears and bond availability wanes 
the new framework must maintain easing gradually adjust easing with 
progress toward price stability prevent sudden market disruptions 
the requirements for new regime are filled framework 
inflation linked yield caps ilyc term that coin mean setting caps 
nominal bond yields that are linked the gap between actual inflation 
rates and the inflation target 
expect boj shift ilyc once three conditions are filled first 
abe must declare end deflation second core price inflation must 
continue approaching third boj must explain the new approach 
thoroughly prior introduction expect introduction autumn 
rce rgan stan ley research 
exhibit the yield curve under ilyc would oddly shaped 
most investors regard ilyc radical and impractical some 
objections stem from practical issues summarize the debate these 
issues exhibit other objections stem from three key misconceptions 
that investors have about the japanese economy address these 
misconceptions the second section this paper 
market implications boj regime change element our call for 
stronger yen this regime change way shift gradually toward less 
accommodative policy price movements warrant such shift believe 
that prices will warrant such shift stronger yen logical conclusion 
for equity markets there will likely short term negative impact from the 
stronger yen however lower longer more certain trajectory for real yields 
should support equities over the longer term

the new quandry 
the boj policy quantitative and qualitative easing qqe has succeeded when gov kuroda took office 
march core inflation japan overall cpi excluding fresh food and energy stood within weeks 
gov kuroda implemented qqe and october core cpi growth had risen while inflation has 
not reached the target that boj intended the progress has been substantial despite weak conditions the 
real economy for details our outlook for prices and wages see below 
now boj faces new problem when and how exit qqe without harming the economy upsetting financial 
markets this hard problem there are good arguments both for and against qqe exit see exhibit each 
with implied timing boj must sail between the scylla the need end what boj itself calls different 
dimensional ijigen japanese measures conditions longer warrant them and the charybdis 
uncertainty about the future prices and the economy boj must design new monetary regime that will allow 
safe passage through this narrow dangerous strait 
exhibit the monetary policy debate should boj end qqe 
rce rgan stan ley research 
what must the new regime 
the new regime must fulfill several criteria the regime must allow very easy monetary policy since the 
inflation rate will still remain below target the regime must flexible enough change direction data 
the wrong way the regime must totally transparent investors and the public the regime must 
avoid triggering sharp movements financial markets monetary policy changes 
the current qqe framework fulfills conditions and however despite success qqe now fails 
condition now that institutions are reluctant sell more jgbs the boj may become hard for boj 
even maintain the current pace trl year jgb buying much less take new measures that could 
respond meaningfully new economic weakness also fails condition because any suggestion 
change the degree bond purchase would trigger sharp market movements indeed any discretionary 
quantity based monetary regime will inevitably have the same problems thus shift yield based monetary 
regime seems inevitable what sort regime might work 
japan economics december 
ilyc inflation linked yield caps 
simple and transparent solution boj dilemma would inflation linked yield cap boj would set cap 
and promise buy all bonds with yields above this cap level certain maturity then boj could change 
the yield cap inflation approaches the inflation target the formula would rcap where 
rcap the cap yield measure underlying price movements and the inflation target short this 
can called inflation linked yield caps ilyc and regime very much like taylor rule but for bond 
yield capping schematic example exhibit 
exhibit ilyc example the cpi approaches the yield cap would approach 
rce min istry tern affairs mmu icatio rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
the simplicity the formula deceptive there are several difficult issues foremost what metric would best 
for our view slowly adjusting metric better than quickly adjusting one light data instability 
and the need adjust slowly shocks slowly adjusting price metric would mean slowing adjusting policy 
and thus would avoid market disruptions for example month trailing average the actual core inflation 
rate might candidate moreover important focus the non volatile homemade parts inflation 
excluding energy prices since japan imports almost all its energy for this reason either the style 
core the boj core cpi indices would likely better than the overall japan core measures 
second should the target focus one point the yield curve apply more broadly the target focuses 
single point there could major distortions yield curve shape around that point when economic conditions 
change hence believe that the target will likely formulated cap yields less than some given 
maturity years what might the yield curve look like exhibit gives schema say the normal yield 
curve smoothly upward sloping when the inflation rate the boj uses ilyc impose yield cap 
after the maturity the curve could determined market forces but there catch 
colleague koichi sugisaki reminds there might sudden jump yields above the maturity which 
would distort investment incentives ilyc yield curve that said the market itself might also smooth the yield 
curve ilyc yield curve hard make prior judgment what might happen 
japan economics december 
exhibit the yield curve under ilyc 
rce rgan stan ley research 
third what should the target maturity this decision must consider the investment horizon for desired real 
economy investments for example the yield cap horizon were set years then there would natural 
tendency focus investments with horizons years not easy decide whether such investment 
horizon optimal for spurring productivity growth moreover sugisaki points out the longer the maturity 
point the yield cap the more disruptive the cap might the short end foreign investors particular have 
been eager buyers the short end the curve the view that boj qqe will remain place thus any abrupt 
move ilyc would risk sharp surge yields the short end light this risk some investors envision 
hybrid system with the boj gradually reducing the purchases under qqe but imposing yield cap the same 
time certain sectors the yield curve order avoid disruptions 
finally what should the terminal yield the yield cap when actual inflation hits target inflation terms 
the formula what should the value parameter think that the correct terminal yield may equal the 
inflation target this would imply that the real interest would ensuring support for capex even once the 
inflation target reached course given the need for accelerated capital accumulation the labor force 
shrinks the desired terminal real yield could negative 
there also one often overlooked benefit from ilyc well transparent automatic flexibility the face data 
fluctuations inflation were exceed expectations then the yield cap formula would allow market yields rise 
quickly but smoothly alternatively prices deteriorate the yield target would lowered automatically 
investors would not have wait with bated breath for the next boj move and could focus tasks such 
efficient capital allocation short ilyc would facilitate smooth exit from qqe lengthen investment horizons 
investors and change the orientation investor focus real economy efficiency 
numerical examples set and then when and the inflation target the formula 
becomes this case the real interest rate because real 
rcap contrast then rcap this case 
the real interest rate 
the japan style core excludes only fresh food the style core excludes all food except alcoholic beverages 
and all energy items the boj core lies between excludes fresh food and energy but includes other food 
japan economics december 
timeline watch wages closely 
the timeline for the shift ilyc will determined both economic and political conditions hallmark the 
abe government has been coordination between the government and the boj confidence depends unified 
view monetary policy hence for any declaration the end deflation the government will have move 
first sufficient for there long string core cpi growth rates above this condition likely 
fulfilled the spring moreover would politically convenient for abe declare end 
deflation prior the upper house election the summer hence expect this declaration from the 
government late spring then the door will open for the boj change the monetary framework after all 
there little reason stick qqe its goal exit from deflation has been achieved 
even after the declaration however there not likely any rush change the policy framework core 
inflation will likely remain below and the hike the consumption tax likely looming moreover the 
boj will want prepare the market for regime change long period discussion seems more likely than 
sudden change believe that the debate will continue through the summer when the public occupied 
with the election only the autumn will the new regime implemented there will have been ample time for 
markets discount and adjust and thus asset market disruptions would likely 
key element uncertainty the shape the phillips curve expect the unemployment rate keep falling 
exhibit the recent trend continues then the unemployment rate will reach end what would 
this mean for wage inflation and for prices 
exhibit the unemployment rate heading end 
rce min istry tern affairs mmu icatio rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
japan economics december 
exhibit two tier phillips curve unemployment wages and prices 
rce min istry tern affairs mmu icatio rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
two tier phillips curve analysis suggests that wage pressures could extremely strong seen the righthand part exhibit the phillips curve turns extremely steep once the unemployment rate falls below 
the unemployment rate indeed falls then the implied hourly wage growth rate would this 
compares with the prediction for unemployment rate which almost precisely the actual 
combination for hourly wages and for the unemployment rate seen moreover wages 
accelerate prices will not far behind correlation between hourly wages and the boj core inflation rate see 
left hand side exhibit shows prices rising linearly with the rise the hourly wage short 
unemployment rate implies wage growth and wage growth implies boj core inflation 
the key debates propositions affirmatives and negatives 
discussions about the potential form for regime change monetary policy have ranged from agree fully 
think you are crazy what are the primary objections and rebuttals see exhibit 
the foremost objection ilyc the potential for disruptions the yield curve which could distort not only 
markets but capital formation well the short end the curve mentioned foreign investors have been 
aggressive buyers the assumption that qqe will continue mere hints regime change could send shortend yields sharply higher there problem the other end the yield curve well where the terminal 
point for the yield cap ends there could sharp surge yields longer maturities current holders 
longer dated bonds might face mark market losses 
another objection the uncertainty that surrounds any change regime even boj explains the current qqe 
facto form real yield targeting the fact that any regime change will require educating investors 
about how the new regime works just when boj switched qqe there could major disruptions 
that said such disruptions would likely limited the bond market with little impact the real economy 
long the yield curve settles quickly 
another debate concerns timing our view important for the boj act autumn first that time 
likely that the government will have declared end deflation remember that key justification for qqe 
was that was extraordinary measure designed help exit from deflation the government declares that 
such exit has occurred then the justification for continuing qqe weakens addition wages are rising faster 
japan economics december 
than most investors think and are likely maintain the recent gains and possibly accelerate see below the 
boj has not changed monetary regime autumn might difficult time once the adverse 
impact the tax hike wages and prices wears off toward end the key argument against autumn 
regime change the consumption tax introduction april this hike could well dampen wage and 
price increases happened thus early regime change might risk repetition the policy mistake 
when boj exited the zero interest rate policy zirp before inflation was sustainably positive 
yet another point from some sources the contention that operation twist within the current qqe 
framework might just effective but less disruptive such policy boj would keep the same purchase 
amounts but lengthen the average duration since the very short end the curve now subject heavy 
buying pressure operation twist might able normalize the yield curve the short end and flatten 
the long end with potential benefits for long term investment this context will important watch the 
mof bond issuance plan due finalized coming weeks unless the issuance plan consistent with any 
operation twist there could unneeded distortions moreover there question about how long 
operation twist could last the current amount qqe light potential constraints total bonds 
available longer maturities 
final objection that ilyc too radical departure from historical monetary policies after all qqe was 
already quite radical and succeeding with ilyc might create impression that the authorities are desperate 
think this criticism incorrect first rate targeting the short end has been the norm monetary policy 
for many decades the use the federal funds rate the the overnight call rate japan second 
colleague matt hornbach reminds even bond yield targeting far from new indeed even after world 
war ended the federal reserve continued cap even long yields what about the explicit link the ilyc 
rule inflation rates that not new either indeed starting march the boj itself used explicit link 
prices the period its zero interest rate policy zirp rate targeting yield targeting and inflation linked 
targeting are neither new nor radical 
similar calculation using one tier phillips curve modeling boj core cpi growth with quadratic 
equation the unemployment rate translates unemployment rate into boj core inflation rate 
the fed itself describes this policy follows between early 
and the federal reserve and the 
treasury agreed cap yields long term bond yields and peg the rate short term treasury bills 
maintaining the peg short term rates eventually required the federal reserve purchase most the bills 
issued the treasury but the firm short term peg resulted longer term treasury rates remaining below the 
cap even after short term rates were allowed rise the federal reserve was able maintain the cap the 
long term bonds without any apparent decoupling private long term rates see

qqe inflation and wages three misconceptions 
morgan stanley mufg securities ltd 
takeshi yamaguchi 
takeshi yamaguchi morganstanleymufg 
many investors seem believe that change the monetary framework under gov kuroda inconceivable 
however the reasons for this belief involve our view some misconceptions here discuss three these 
misconception boj focuses monetary base expansion 
believe that gov kuroda large majority the monetary policy committee and the boj policy planning 
bureau monetary affairs department not view expansion the monetary base per direct 
transmission channel for policy the more important transmission channel under qqe rather the interest rate 
channel downward pressure nominal interest rates across the yield curve and the resulting drop real 
interest rates that accompanies the rise inflation expectations 
the crucial official document outlining the boj view the transmission channels qqe was the may 
qqe review the planning bureau said that foresaw the following transmission channels 
conversion the deflationary mindset and rise people inflation expectations will realized through 
the bank implementation large scale monetary expansion under two types its commitments namely 
strong and clear commitment achieving the price stability target percent the earliest possible time 
with time horizon about two years and commitment continue with qqe long necessary for 
maintaining that target stable manner 
downward pressure will put nominal interest rates across the entire yield curve through massive 
purchases jgbs 
real interest rates will lowered due the effects and 
the decline real interest rates will stimulate private demand which will lead upturn the economy 
and improvement the output gap 
with the output gap improving together with rise people inflation expectations described 
actual inflation rates will rise 
the actual inflation rate increases people inflation expectations will increase further 
meanwhile the financial front asset prices such stock prices and exchange rates will formed 
reflecting anticipation the aforementioned movements the economy and prices 
moreover due the strengthening investors preference for risky assets portfolio rebalancing effects 
not only positive effects the prices such assets but also those the quantitative side finance including 
increase lending can expected 
seen this document boj focuses the transmission channel that would work through raising expected 
inflation its strong commitment the inflation target and the resulting downward pressure 
nominal interest rates across the yield curve indeed just after the implementation qqe april there 
was immense downward pressure nominal interest rates and real rates went negative exhibit

rce jap rgan stan ley research 
there debate whether increases the monetary base have direct impact household and corporate 
inflation expectations and the exchange rate but the official view the boj planning bureau does not 
consider this transmission channel gov kuroda has repeated this official view often press conferences 
and there difference between his view and that the planning department both for organizational 
reasons and fact 
the very few official documents that differ with this view the most important the material used deputy 
gov kikuo iwata his august speech the transmission mechanism qqe chart labeled 
transmission channels the qqe there arrow that directly connects inflation expectations with 
monetary base increase however when dep gov iwata explained this graph said the second pillar the 
qqe that underpins this commitment and here described increase the monetary base there 
absolutely reference the mechanism saying that increases the monetary base directly raise money 
stock directly through bank lending old textbooks dep gov iwata intention may have been different from 
the content the speech but any event his view appears minority view within the monetary policy 
committee 
misconception exit from deflation achieving the inflation target 
have quarrel with the view that achieving stable rise prices will require more time and continued 
aggressive monetary easing however one must separate the ideas exit from deflation and achieving the 
inflation target number different indicators suggest that japan already the process achieving 
exit from deflation 
investors appear have strong preconception that inflation japan much lower than the and 
europe however japan core inflation rate already higher than levels the and europe compare 
the yoy change using cpi that also excludes rent which measured very differently across countries from 
each country core index that removes energy and food products exhibit 
japan economics december 
principle price measurement for the cpi tries utilize prices for the same volume and quality much 
possible yet rent japan cpi data does not make quality adjustment rent for aging related deterioration 
contrast the cpi for example say tenant pays the same rent each month japan cpi data rent 
growth will zero however because the gradual deterioration the quality housing over time the cpi 
measurement should adjusted reflect that the rent paid for the same quality service effective rent 
rising slowly over time this the same concept adjusting for the effective increase the price candy say 
the price bag candy stays constant while the amount the bag falls the ministry internal affairs 
communications mic fact makes this sort adjustment but the absence such adjustments for rent one 
reason for the ongoing decline rent the cpi statistics 
tsutomu watanabe professor the university tokyo estimates that the impact from aging deterioration 
amounts yoy rent simple estimate suggests that making quality adjustment for aging 
deterioration would lift cpi about yoy since the weight rent and imputed rent calculated from the 
rent value this item corresponds the assumed rent that homeowners pay themselves the cpi basket 
think the impact yoy change cpi could significantly larger depending the quality 
adjustment method because the large weight the rent related items 
the services statistics and corporate statistics working group under the cabinet office statistics committee has 
repeatedly debated the issue quality adjustment for rent and committee members have expressed 
shared understanding that the statistical bureau the mic should disclose data estimates with rent 
adjustment the earliest possible timing apr mar however some members think the 
mic should accelerate the release estimated values see possibility the mic clarifying interim progress 
during apr mar additionally think investors should pay attention the risk the boj 
going beyond the new core that excludes energy and fresh produce and adding emphasis cpi excluding rent 
during without waiting for the mic estimate results japan core cpi excluding energy fresh food and 
rent already the upper yoy range this point exhibit 
exhibit japan has highest core inflation excluding rent the cpi energy food and rent yoy

misconception wages are not rising 
prices for services which account for about half the cpi basket reflect the wage trend after deducting rent 
and utilities whether signs steady rise wages exist important point assessing whether prices will 
sustainably increase some investors take pessimistic view that wages for part time workers who lack 
bargaining power will not grow this concept assumes that the result wage negotiations held each spring 
labor unions representing full time employees large companies with substantial bargaining power 
determines the wage level japan 
the contrary our estimate the hourly wage for part time workers indicates faster growth pace than the 
average full time employees the growth rate for hourly wages paid part time workers has been 
accelerating and reached about yoy july september exhibit the impact tighter labor market 
conditions directly lifts wages for part time workers because they move companies with better terms they 
are not satisfied with wages such movement forces companies raise the hourly wage order recruit 
enough people although the increase the share part time workers lower wage level still continues 
have downward impact the overall average wage the strong wage growth rate for part time workers 
contributing moderate improvement the average wage total basis exhibit 
foresee continuation tight labor market during japan unemployment rate the lowest level 
years oct data partly due retirement baby boomers expect further acceleration 
the wage increase rate for part time workers japan proceeds with increase the minimum wage 
prime minister abe has presented policy for raising the minimum wage year from the 
current national average with goal also anticipate moderate upward trend for wages
