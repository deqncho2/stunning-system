growth strategy low hanging fruit but 
higher jumps needed 
japan could add pts labor productivity growth for the next 
years reforms are implemented thoroughly far however the 
pace reform far slower than needed achieve this potential

productivity acceleration crucial for abenomics most investors are 
pessimistic about even the possibility productivity acceleration our view 
more optimistic see possibility that japan could add points year 
productivity growth over year period simply adopting practices that 
already exist elsewhere

content and implementation the growth strategy includes good news 
mediocre news and bad news the good news comes agriculture and 
corporate governance the mediocre news comes education tax and 
government reforms the bad news comes energy immigration labor 
election and medical reforms 
taking all the news into account our conclusion two fold first the 
third arrow has accelerated productivity growth some areas second the 
third arrow has not done enough raise japanese productivity the 
needed reach abe growth goal our message remains trust but

the hurdle 
despite many successes abenomics still faces fundamental hurdle productivity growth the reason simple 
identity that gdp equals productivity multiplied simple terms when there are fewer 
workers each worker must work more efficiently order achieve higher growth rate abenomics wants 
achieve real gdp growth rate even while demographics push employment down about per 
year the growth rate productivity would have rate productivity growth even within 
the realm possibility 
history and future japanese labor productivity exhibit presents short history japanese 
productivity growth during the high growth period labor productivity grew nearly per year after the 
first oil crisis this shifted about for the last years the average has been about the next question 
how predict future productivity growth 
the pessimistic view summarized the secular stagnation debate the view gordon who posits secular 
decline productivity exhibit this view expressed the curved long term declining trend line 
this trend were hold japanese labor productivity growth would fall below zero 
exhibit where will productivity growth three theories

rates this becomes 
see the paradox the secular stagnation thesis manoj pradhan the global macro analyst

less pessimistic view the step function view this view asserts that certain periods have certain levels 
average productivity growth changes productivity growth are triggered global economic crises for japan 
the sharp drop from nearly was contemporaneous with the breakdown the breton woods system 
and first oil crisis the early the second productivity growth drop was contemporaneous with the 
collapse the japanese equity bubble the and the subsequent slide into deflation 
both theories however suffer from crucial weakness they only describe productivity deceleration but not 
explain for explanation one must economic growth theory which analyzes growth terms the 
contributions labor capital and technology unfortunately despite many insightful attempts measure and 
integrate these contributions there has yet emerge workable method raise productivity growth 
remains conundrum for example why the stunning improvements technology over the last years 
internet mobile communications energy efficiency etc have not accelerated productivity 
practical matter there are three contenders for japan productivity growth forecasts the first that the 
long term curved trend will dominate and doom the nation stagnation exhibit this view labeled the 
decaying trend view the second simple extension recent productivity growth this view the 
most common policymaker circles the third the abe goal about which the productivity growth 
needed achieve the abenomics growth target the assertion that abenomics growth policies will 
bring major acceleration productivity 
one potential explanation the cabbage effect which stems from mis measurement gdp the name 
derives from the charming book the origins gdp statistics gdp brief but affectionate history prof 
diane coyle princeton university press the book the author thanks cabbage the dog who contributes 
not all gdp but greatly welfare

how much could japanese productivity accelerate 
many investors doubt whether acceleration productivity growth possible japan however see 
more optimistic possibility the gaps between japanese labor productivity and that the can extremely 
large see exhibits course some sectors japan such general machinery and chemicals are more 
productive than the however such sectors are rarities the japanese construction sector only about 
productive its counterpart the wholesale retail sector only productive and the 
hotel restaurant sector only productive

these calculations suggest surprising opportunity for productivity gain japan using value added weight 
the productivity each sector the overall labor productivity for japan comes about where the 
defined for each sector exhibit column all japanese sectors below the level raised 
productivity that level then japan productivity would about since two sectors are above the 
short japanese productivity would from gain about this gain were realized 
even over year period the addition productivity growth would about points per year 
where are the biggest opportunities the sectors that could gain the most productivity are electric machinery 
utilities other manufacturing transportation and warehousing wholesale and retail trade and 
restaurants hospitality note also that the meti table does not even include agriculture sector where further 
huge increases productivity are also possible

productivity acceleration crucial for abenomics most investors are pessimistic about even the possibility 
productivity acceleration and many think that productivity may decelerate our view optimistic the 
possibility productivity acceleration light the many large sectors where productivity lags international

simply adopting practices that already exist elsewhere

good news 
agriculture abe has restructured the entire japan agricultural coop system triggered the 
resignation the chairman banzai who opposed japan entering the trans pacific partnership trade 
negotiations and changing the structure reduce the power the center and give more power local 
coops this change will create competition among the coops and allow them compete freely both home 
and abroad there have also been some changes the agricultural land laws allow corporations own 
more agricultural plots allow year leases and reduce the role the agricultural 
committees each local community which have been major impediment better land use 
corporate governance the government has implemented several major changes index this new 
index has changed the incentives for corporate management because the criteria for inclusion the index 
perceived club the best companies firm wants the club must earn higher roe than 
others and fulfill other criteria both qualitative and quantitative stewardship code these are new rules 
for institutional investors which require more active oversight invested companies corporate 
governance code the new code will require more outside directors and trigger more sale cross holdings

mediocre news 
education university reforms have been implemented order allow professors work more closely with 
companies monetization research projects addition large number universities are changing their 
academic year allow students and professors study teach abroad more easily still tackled the 
issue cost benefit oecd comparisons suggest that japan spends relatively little per student education 
however the results not suggest that even this small amount money spent effectively such the 
case english proficiency students 
tax reform several steps have been taken reduce tax rates order spur investment and 
reduce distortions for example there has been expansion the nisa account tax free securities investment 
accounts eligibility corporate income tax rates were cut pts for the new fiscal year with 
cut scheduled for order spur sale small cross holdings share among firms which 
dilute the incentive for active governance the income deduction for corporations with small cross holdings 
have been sharply reduced from broaden the tax take and spur efficiency local tax rates 
value added with exemption for wage hikes and corporate capital were raised while taxes corporate 
income were cut another round such changes scheduled for spur joint research projects across 
firms and academia the income deduction for such research was raised from depending the 
nature the research 
government reform the government created personnel office inside the pm office this allows the 
control far broader set appointments much deeper into the bureaucracy the result has been much better 
control policy tax and social spending reform

morgan stanley mufg research 
bad news 
energy the energy budget for was cut make more room for social spending even though energy 
spending trl while social spending trl moreover comprehensive energy policy has been 
downplayed light the focus what share electric power will come from nuclear energy moreover meti 
taking policies that will further constrain the spread solar energy for details see insight energy long 
trek the best mix robert feldman morgan stanley march 
labor reform there have been proposed only minor changes labor law white collar exemption 
dispatched worker rules worker rights remain highly unclear there has been progress rules for 
monetary compensation for dismissal japanese kinsen kaiketsu specifying how equal pay for 
equal work will achieved both large and small business have blocked reform large business satisfied 
with lifetime employment for their own firms despite the chilling effect that this has economy wide labor 
mobility skill acquisition and productivity small business effectively exempt from current legal practice any 
clarification dismissal obligations would raise costs for small business and they have blocked reform 
medical intense battle has begun over medical spending reform the good news that those wanting 
nationalize and suppress spending are winning the debate the bad news that confidence any upcoming 
announcements due end june will remain low until final budgets are enacted resistance change remains 
strong among supplier organizations such the japan medial association the japan pharmaceutical 
association and the japan nursing association 
election reform progress election reform has been slow and now appears stalled the upper house has 
now officially abandoned talks among parties the revision the upper house electoral system which the 
supreme court ruled unconstitutional recently unless action taken within few months will impossible 
have the upper house election under new system and the supreme court could rule the 
election invalid for the lower house external commission experts has been created but deliberations 
have stalled the commission waits for action the upper house the one bright spot has been enactment 
reduction the voting age 
immigration attitudes toward immigration are becoming more positive albeit slowly first the recent surge 
tourists visible all parts the nation has increased familiarity with foreigners and has increased 
confidence that the net impact immigration could positive second the burden care for the elderly 
driving force for immigration reform because foreign workers could ease the burden nursing care 
families concrete policies foreign workers and immigration however have been modest some the 
special economic zones there have been moves allow foreign workers take household jobs

conclusion 
taking the good news mediocre news and bad news into account our conclusion two fold 
first the third arrow has accelerated productivity growth some sectors see the actions agriculture 
and corporate governance highly likely lead accelerated improvement resource use the opportunities 
agriculture are immense light the growing global demand for high quality food the focus corporate 
governance has also pushed capital efficiency increased roe the top the agenda for managers along 
with tax changes that will strengthen incentives for reduced cross holdings equities the improvements 
corporate governance will likely improve capital allocation 
unfortunately the third arrow far has not raised japanese productivity growth the needed 
reach abe gdp growth goal the slow movement medical sector reforms major barrier 
faster improvement efficiency the slow and sometimes backward movement energy policy 
regulation continues hamper adoption leading edge technology both medical and energy areas 
continued inflexibility labor rules also lowers the efficiency labor use and harms the incentives for skill 
acquisition while immigration reform remains bottleneck providing services that the elderly need 
maintain our basic view abenomics trust but verify enough has been done and enough train 
maintain confidence that the initiative track however there much left and more aggressive 
policies are needed order for potential achieved
