japan key economic challenge productivity growth 
identify sectors that are potentially attractive investors 
realizing this potential will require regulatory reforms exit 
from deflation forceful corporate technology strategies and 
global trade expansion 
the government annual economic policy statement the thick boned policy 
honebuto hoshin hereafter hbh due mid june given the unfinished 
agenda growth policy this document will crucial investor evaluations 
the outlook for growth japan 
the key economic challenge for japan accelerate productivity growth with 
the working population falling faster than the overall population the remaining 
workers must work more productively merely maintain overall living 
standards much less raise them 
this paper looks three related topics first what are the productivity growth 
trends both the macro and industry levels second does information now 
available suggest that the upcoming hbh will enhance productivity growth 
significantly third based the answers these two questions where are the 
potential investment opportunities 
conclude that macro productivity growth tfp total factor productivity 
has been very sluggish but that the variation among industries has been huge 
ranging from year electronic devices year mining the 
upcoming hbh suggests the potential for some gains but the pace policydriven progress may remain slow this basis propose that the best 
investment opportunities may lie restructuring the industries that have the 
combination large workforces but low productivity growth 
macro calculations tfp suggest greatest potential for productivity 
acceleration sectors such hotels restaurants healthcare other services 
construction wholesale retail professional services education finance food 
manufacturing agriculture parts telecommunications and civil service that 
said realizing such potential will require faster regulatory reform faster 
exit from deflation forceful corporate strategies diffuse new technologies 
part due the labor shortage and avoiding the negative impact 
protectionist threats global trade the balance among these factors will 
the key element determining the final outcome

very short history productivity growth japan and america 
labor productivity defined here real gdp divided number employed japan 
has followed curve shape over the postwar period exhibit fitting logistic time 
trend curve this series suggests that the underlying growth rate productivity 
now about per year the sustainability the japanese economy depends 
whether this productivity curve can reaccelerate

the history labor productivity suggests that the answer may yes from 
about labor productivity the was rising linear trend however from 
around spurred part world war the trend assumed curve shape 
hit inflection point the and flattened the late then quite 
astonishingly new curve emerged with acceleration phase until the late 
and subsequent flattening these facts raise two crucial questions why did labor 
productivity reaccelerate from the mid onward and can japan take actions that 
would replicate such history 
admit not having conclusive econometric evidence the reasons for the 
reacceleration labor productivity growth however several reasons seem likely 
first computer technology advances that bore fruit the personal computer and 
telecommunications technology second deregulation major industries such 
airlines the and telecoms resulted rapid spread new efficient 
technologies and incentives develop and spread yet newer technologies such 
the internet third the corporate governance reforms the enhanced the 
pressure companies use technology effectively fourth the expansion global 
trade and outsourcing increased both economies scale and improved division labor 
seems reasonable think that the interaction these factors brought new 
productivity curve the 
could conditions today replicate this experience japan first new technologies are 
developing very rapidly second however the pace deregulation japan not 
particularly fast despite some moves abenomics some industries agriculture 
third there have indeed been several reforms corporate governance over the last 
few years but questions still remain about how much pressure for higher returns felt 
corporate management our conclusion that these three conditions exist 
qualitatively japan but may not sufficient 
analysis aggregate japanese productivity growth 
earlier work have analyzed productivity growth japan used two 
approaches descriptive and analytical updated version the descriptive 
approach shown exhibit this description the basic identity shows that labor 
productivity equals the product capital efficiency and capital 
intensity after the japanese financial crisis and the asia crisis the late 
the long decline capital efficiency reversed but the rise capital intensity 
plateaued balance labor productivity continued rise about the same pace 
however after the global financial crisis even though capital efficiency began rise 
again capital intensity surprisingly began decline the result has been anemic 
growth labor productivity short labor productivity growth has been slow 
because japan has not invested enough 
exhibit components labor productivity 
note output per worker the product

calculations 
more analytical approach productivity use production function and estimate 
how much growth output comes from labor from capital and from the residual 
interpreted total factor productivity tfp our research calculated that tfp 
has decelerated since the and grew only per year the 
period 
productivity sectoral data 
while aggregate productivity calculations are interesting they tell little about where 
invest for this need more granular sector data 
the two main sources sector data that are often used japanese macro analysis are 
the ministry finance corporate statistics and national accounts data the former are 
entirely nominal but have the benefit having breakdown size firm exhibit 
show sectoral data capital efficiency defined operating profits gdp deflator 
divided the sum tangible and intangible fixed assets and capital intensity sum 
tangible and intangible fixed assets divided employment the dashed lines the 
graph show the combination capital efficiency and capital intensity that would 
generate average labor productivity for the sector 
capital

two things are immediately apparent from the graph first non large firms have lower 
labor productivity than large firms due both components second there are only 
few industries above the border line between above average and below average and 
many industries below while these data are not regarded highly reliable due 
frequent sample changes and other issues they nevertheless suggest that some parts 
the economy are highly efficient and others very much less 
the national accounts data have sectors including both aggregate manufacturing 
and its subcomponents this data set presents both real capital stock and real 
output data along with employment sector both numbers persons and hours 
worked employees but not all workers using these data which start 
one can estimate production functions for each sector and calculate tfp growth 
results such calculations are shown exhibit average tfp growth over the period was mere this average however reflects some sectors that did 
quite well and some quite poorly large number sectors showed negative tfp 
growth largely due structural recession those sectors petroleum refining and 
mining being obvious examples contrast the highest growth tfp was electronic 
device manufacturing and telecom equipment manufacturing likely reflecting the high 
economies scale and rapid technology improvements while one should not put too 
much emphasis the exact numbers the qualitative lesson clear there has been 
huge dispersion among tfp growth among sectors and this opens potential investment 
opportunities 
exhibit tfp growth and employment sector 
source cabinet office for underlying data and morgan stanley calculations 
exhibit also shows the size employment for each sector millions workers 
while the manufacturing sector whole had reasonably high tfp growth and 
employed about mln there are many high employment sectors with very low 
negative tfp growth these sectors may well have the most low hanging fruit for 
investors management individual firms can devise new business plans raise 
productivity among the sectors with employment more than four million but low 
tfp growth are hotels restaurants healthcare other services construction 
wholesale retail and professional services 
japanese government research the topic comes similar conclusions seen the 
ministry economy trade and industry white paper international economy and 
trade the edition the results that analysis based data from are 
shown the appendix 
short industry level data suggest that dispersion both levels and growth 
productivity key feature the japanese industrial structure this characteristic 
could opportunity for business model innovation and technology diffusion these 
data also suggest that broadening and hastening the diffusion technology should 
key element economic policy 
the upcoming hbh will help accelerate productivity growth 
june the government released the draft version the hbh final version due 
mid june but unlikely differ significantly the document has very keen 
understanding the need accelerate productivity growth the hbh draft for 
says that urgent that raise the potential rate growth through 
productivity improvements based stronger innovation etc there are some areas 
where that urgency beginning impact policy but many others where the document 
represents only continuation current policies 
order qualify for these 
exemptions there are many provisions 
the professional must earn least 
three times the average pay the firm 
the professional must have high 
degree expertise different from that 
other employees the professional 
must have specific job description 
the professional must sign 
agreement with the firm that she 
understands the rules the 
labor management committee the 
firm must agree rules withdraw 
professional from the system the 
firm must ensure that the professional 
does not work during days per year 
and takes least days off every four 
weeks the firm must ensure health 
protection measures for the worker 
through work interval enforcement 
special health examinations requiring 
two weeks more continuous 
vacation etc

labor reform succeed morgan 
stanley march and report 
card work style reform morgan 
stanley april 
the hbh rightly starts with the framework that enhancing growth means addressing 
issues labor capital and technology labor the document calls for increased 
numbers foreign workers some less skilled categories step forward 
however the document explicitly states that immigration permanent move 
workers japan not element thus reducing the incentive learn japanese 
for longer payout period the hbh also calls for better educational 
opportunities for those who may fall behind the current system and better 
support for working women that they can stay the labor force through 
better wages for nursing care workers which would lower the number people 
who must quit work care for aged family members that said the amount 
money dedicated trl with reference increases 
the most troubling aspect the hbh labor was the extremely strict provisions 
for exemptions new labor hours laws for professionals earlier pieces 
have expressed our concerns that the work style reforms might hinder productivity 
growth the new hbh anything increases these concerns 
business investment there are only five references the term the entire 
document key focus spreading business investment new technologies 
small businesses but new measures are mentioned rather the document notes 
the relationship business investment other policy areas such labor 
availability and regulatory issues 
the hbh mentions technology progress many times with particular emphasis iot 
and there specific mention this issue the context healthcare and thus 
some acceleration may expected database creation and patient information 
transparency presuming ironclad privacy protections there also new goal 
raise the ratio spending the economy more than from recent levels 
somewhat over 
our view the two key measures 
are agricultural land law changes 
allow full corporate ownership farm 
land and land taxation regular 
rates for agricultural land that not 
being farmed 
overall however the hbh leaves the impression that policy will not drive faster 
technology diffusion example agriculture while calling for increased use 
artificial intelligence and iot the hbh does not mention the key regulatory and tax 
changes needed make technology diffuse faster current and potential farmers 
indeed few the mentions regulatory change hbh suggest accelerating 
current regulatory reforms 
originally the decision cost 
benefit analysis for medicines was due 
end but disagreements within 
the decision committee resulted 
postponement see feldman robert 
fiscal sustainability the crucial 
role healthcare reform may 
another focus the hbh fiscal reform the hbh recognizes that the initial 
abenomics goal surplus the primary balance will not achieved and sets 
the target that said hbh also pledges implement the extra spending 
needed offset potential negative impact from the scheduled october 
consumption tax hike tax and spend policy moreover little provided the 
crucial issue what combination tax hikes and spending cuts will used 
achieve the target

that said the new hbh includes some commitment better cost control especially 
the social security system the term cost benefit analysis used several times

investment conclusion 
the foundations investment strategy for japan must based part 
productivity trends this paper have learned that productivity growth overall 
has been sluggish but some sectors have had quite high productivity growth while 
others have been negative government policy productivity conceptually sound 
but implementation has lagged and some cases labor market reform has been 
odds with the goal under these circumstances what might investors want 
think that the answer seek big productivity laggards where regulatory reform 
starting occur the easy part finding the big productivity laggards seen 
exhibit above the big laggards include hotels restaurants healthcare other services 
construction wholesale retail and professional services there are also number 
medium sized laggards such education finance food manufacturing agriculture 
parts telecommunications and civil service

the harder part where regulatory reform starting occur good way 
approach this issue our cric cycle the cycle crisis response improvement and 
complacency that describes the interaction policy and markets regulatory 
reform type response and thus must follow some type crisis the first 
question where will the crises occur the second question whether the response 
will reform reaction attempt revert old ways this question depends 
largely the strength vested interests and how closely they are tied 
regulatory decision making the bigger the crisis the easier overcome vested 
interests decision rules the structure governance also matter when the 
new rules are decided those who benefit from the old rules then progress 
likely slow 
where are some the potential crises what will the reactions firms and 
regulators 
the most obvious crisis the labor shortage wages labor intensive sectors and 
small firms have been under more upward pressure than those capital intensive 
sectors and large firms corporate responses include raising wages making working 
conditions more flexible and substituting capital for labor these responses are 
happening across broad set labor intensive industries 
this response regulators was the 
result decision making those who 
benefit most from the current system 
see feldman robert alan will labor 
reform succeed morgan stanley 
march and report card 
work style reform morgan 
stanley april 
the regulatory response ironically has been make labor conditions less flexible 
through setting legally binding targets for work hours once these laws are 
fully implemented over the next months they are likely increase the labor 
crisis for labor intensive firms even further hence searching for successful 
companies investors may wish focus firms that are reacting constructively 
labor shortages and how reorganization those industries might make them both 
less labor intensive and less impacted the new labor laws 
according the ministry health 
labor and welfare per capita costs for 
those the age range 
per year for 
for for 
etc see 
http mhlw file pdf 
second brewing crisis healthcare the hbh correctly points out the baby 
boom generation will begin turning the per capita cost medical care 
skyrockets after age even without the impact more expensive new 
technologies the aging the aged could put huge burden medical spending 
hence there will severe price cutting pressure throughout the healthcare system 
not only pharmaceuticals but also nursing care preventive care etc firms that 
help hold down costs either through better business models more cost effective 
treatments stand gain 
macro forces could accelerate the healthcare trend once inflation approaches the 
government goal will difficult for the bank japan justify holding longterm yields extremely low levels although the large amount and long duration 
bonds issued very low coupons will prevent interest costs debt from rising rapidly 
the direction yields will clear significant increases market yields will likely 
trigger extra pressure for fiscal adjustment the pressure for fiscal cost control would 
only grow and thus open the way for faster diffusion cost saving technologies not 
only healthcare but other government services well

third crisis brewing agriculture the average age japanese farmers 
and the distribution has become more skewed toward the elderly moreover 
japan self sufficiency ratio food measured calories only compared 
the and germany while the need for much more efficient 
agriculture clear agriculture tfp growth seen exhibit above was negative 
the period the hbh proposes very few measures

there have been agriculture crises japan including the rice riots and the 
postwar food shortages the most recent was when bad weather forced the 
import rice for the first time the postwar period that incident triggered series 
reforms and began slow process deregulation more recently slow crisis 
developing today about agricultural land unused partly result 
aged farmers being unable farm their lands moreover the agricultural products 
distribution system remains dominated quasi monopoly organizations another 
crisis triggered weather disturbances home abroad might trigger 
regulatory reforms such revising agricultural land laws allow corporate 
ownership and thus spur farm consolidation impose standard land taxes 
underutilized low taxed farm land such reforms would allow increased production 
through use new technology such drones

the list potential crises and responses much longer than can discuss here our 
view the key point that the opportunities for investment will come big laggard 
industries and that these opportunities will realized when crises trigger responses
