inflation expectations japan have started rise see exhibit have used 
arithmetic mean geometric mean harmonic mean sigmoid mean and 
gaussian mean along with diffusion index derive this conclusion all six 
these measures inflation expectations give the same qualitative result 
believe that the government and the boj are correct believing that the 
deterioration inflation expectations temporary 
the different methods extracting inflation expectations give very different 
levels inflation expectations all measures are too high because they 
consistently exceed inflation measured both the overall cpi and the cpi 
excluding food and energy cpi all and cpi xfe respectively though 
expectations measure overwhelmingly attractive think that the most 
reasonable the sigmoid mean 
none the measures has long term forecasting power all retain measure 
statistical significance actual price movements for few months but none for 
more than that short inflation expectations tell lot about expectations 
but not much about inflation

how measure japanese consumer inflation expectations 
measuring inflation expectations prickly problem one method derive them 
from market movements such those inflation linked bonds however the implicit 
assumptions are huge that markets are sufficiently deep and foresighted are not 
influenced other factors etc moreover even bond market expectations are 
correctly measured expectations the general public may not hence survey data 
inflation expectations the consumers are most useful 
however consumer inflation expectations data too are fraught with problems such 
sample size various biases and technical difficulties translating qualitative data into 
quantitative outcomes moreover the exact survey questions and the structure the 
data can also make derivation accurate inflation expectations difficult the final issue 
whether inflation expectations actually have forecasting power vis vis actual future 
inflation 
this report focus inflation expectations the general public because this 
the key focus monetary policy the most direct data this matter are the monthly 
surveys done the cabinet office the data are included the current consumption 
survey the section called price expectations one year ahead few observations 
the questionnaire and the structure the data are important finding good 
methods for deriving inflation expectations 
first what question does the cabinet office ask the specific question what you 
think will happen over the next year the prices the goods that your household 
buys regularly the survey then asks respondents choose one amount price 
change from nine bands ranging from fall more than rise more than 
there also not know choice the data are presented the form the 
percent respondents who chose each band the cabinet office also aggregates the 
data into four larger categories stay down and not know from these 
data that must tease out average inflation expectation example the survey 
results shown exhibit graphical form with the percentages each band shown 
solid circles 
the bank japan also publishes quarterly data consumer price expectations 
however the cabinet office data are more directly usable because the form which 
the data are published first boj data are quarterly not monthly second although the 
boj data are also classified into bands expectations between and the 
boj does not publish time series the shares responses each band rather 
publishes summaries qualitative categories such will significantly without 
precise definition which numerical bands are which qualitative category short 
the cabinet office data are more usable for our purpose because they are monthly 
and presented clearly identifiable numerical bands for example the boj 
expectations data see bank japan results the opinion survey the 
general public views and behavior september survey october 
the explanation goes say please answer the basis how much you 
expect prices rise fall this time next year for goods that are purchased 
regularly the basis various sources information such television and 
newspapers well your daily purchases the term prices goods that are 
purchased regularly means the money prices that you actually pay for these goods 
including the various taxes that are levied the time the purchase 
the alternatives are fall more than fall more than but less 
than fall more than but less than fall about 
rise rise more than but less than rise more than 
but less than rise more not know

reported data 
about 
cumulated data 
note the round dots represent the reported data and the triangles represent the cumulation those data

how find the central tendency this distribution one obvious candidate the 
weighted average the mid points the ranges the problem with this method the 
tails for example there mid point for the numbers above our 
calculations simply used the two end points and calculate the 
weighted average for the weights exclude the not know share and rebase the 
other weights the sum the others for the data exhibit this weighted average 
see exhibit listed the arithmetic mean 
exhibit inflation expectations indicators nov 
however there are several other ways extract the central 
tendency and they can generate very different results one 
the geometric mean this calculation starts with the mid point 
endpoint each range and adds this value from the 
result then exponentiated the share observations the 
range for example for the range fall more than 
november the weight hence the 
contribution factor this band the total would the corresponding values across all 
bands are then multiplied for november the resulting 
product from this value subtract and convert percent thus the 
geometric average for november

source morgan stanley research calculations 
also calculate harmonic mean which uses the harmonic equivalent the 
geometric formula used above for example for the first band take the weight 
and divide similar calculation for each band 
and sum the results then take the inverse the sum and subtract order get 
the percent change for november the harmonic mean these results 
suggest the arithmetic geometric and harmonic means are very close 
the next method quite different and can termed the sigmoid mean cumulate 
the data from the bands and then fit sigmoid curve through the data through the 
triangles exhibit the median value from this estimation the reading inflation 
expectations the sigmoid mean for november was 
also known curve sigmoid curve defined the equation 
the value the point where reaches order fit the curve use rootmean squared error calculation 
the next method called the gaussian mean this method takes the data each band 
and fits curve based the gaussian normal distribution the benefit this method 
that the distribution well known the drawback that does not allow skewness 
the gaussian mean for november was 
the final method does not give inflation expectations level but merely looks the 
difference between those who think inflation will positive and those who not 
excluding not know answers this calculation just diffusion index and hence 
label the for november the was 
the behavior all these indicators inflation expectations given exhibit from 
the start abenomics january through the latest data for november 
there much volatility across measures and the gaussian mean has particularly large 
discontinuities the levels all measures are too high since they consistently exceed 
both the cpi all and cpi xfe note the not measure the level expectations 
themselves however its path follows the arithmetic mean closely

although the levels inflation expectations and the volatility differ greatly across 
measures the direction change largely similar they all tend improve 
deteriorate the same time most importantly the last few months all have begun 
rise this result gives evidence favor the view that inflation expectations are 
starting rise 
inflation expectations help forecast actual inflation 
another important issue whether inflation expectations have reliable information about 
actual inflation the future exhibits and present two simple tests how well the 
different measures expected inflation forecast actual inflation cpi all and cpi xfe 
the test looks the statistic each inflation expectations measure when trying 
forecast actual inflation given horizon the future 
the results are clear for the cpi all all the inflation measures have modest 
forecasting power for few months but not much longer even two months hence the 
statistics are low for the cpi xfe the results are modestly more encouraging the tstatistics for all measures are more the horizon that said there only

conclusions 
our conclusions from this research are among the various inflation expectations 
measures tested the most reasonable overall measure the sigmoid average and 
among these measures most have reliable forecasting power for short time but none 
has reliable forecasting power for more than few months
