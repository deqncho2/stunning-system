think however that the room for further large increase 
labor force participation japan may limited the concave 
portion the shape for the women aged based labor 
participation profile has flattened out considerably pointing 
slower increase female labor participation ahead exhibit 
think that japan female participation rate only modestly 
lower than other advanced countries once corrected for the 
population age structure and measurement differences the 
male participation rate already high and recently has not 
changed much exhibit 
slope the phillips curve flattened but tight labor market 
will still raise wages ahead 
expect that wages japan will continue rise mainly 
market forces supply and demand not pressure from the 
government urging companies raise pay the labor market

exhibit 
almost changes male labor participation rates

one caveat that wages may become less responsive the 
unemployment rate exhibit think the main reason 
behind the flattening the phillips curve unemployment rate 
and wages curve slope rise the shift toward non regular 
workers who are paid lower than regular workers this 
replacement partly reflected demographics rehiring older 
workers previously employed full time basis 
non regular employees lower wages via part time contracts 
and other arrangements after scheduled retirement lowers the 
average wage besides aging sharp rise part time and 
other shorter hour work mainly women the labor market 
also lifting the non regular employment ratio
