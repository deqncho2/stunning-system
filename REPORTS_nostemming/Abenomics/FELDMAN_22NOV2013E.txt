has role supporting innovation for example the abe 
government started the worlds fastest computer the super 
computer miyako plan was the fastest the world for 
while and built kobe and also kobe there were 
spins off sorts focusing regenerative medical areas etc 
these firms are focusing many difficult diseases and 
developing new medications these innovations create new 
technology raise productivity and create employment this 
raises growth 
cut spending end deflation raise revenue 
solve the fiscal problem have cut sharply the things 
that need cutting and have raise tax revenue order 
raise tax revenue just raising tax rates not enough with 
deflation really hard get tax revenues and have 
escape from deflation during the abe government deflation 
eased and the yen weakened with exports rising had 
gdp trl tax revenue nominal gdp was trl and kept 
spending down trl now with only trl tax revenue

the essence abenomics changing incentives the macro policy game 
the debate over accord can seen combination 
macroeconomics and game theory the payoffs are 
determined the macroeconomic outcome and the 
preferences the players 
aggressive aggressive outcome 
would require the following payoff 
matrix 
you were here 
historically there was 
passive passive outcome 
where neither the boj nor the 
government took 
aggressive stance its 
policies end deflation each 
asking the other more 
but making only grudging 
concessions its own 
accord would change the 
payoffs and possibly change

scenario 
the details show nominal gdp growth averaging 
from and real growth 
this means that the gdp deflator rising 
about per year quite consistent with the 
cpi target this scenario also says that 
unemployment will fall and that the tenyear jgb yield will rise 
short this scenario says that the first and third 
arrows abenomics monetary policy and

what sorts fiscal futures are possible 
with this macro background let 
summarize the alternatives 
first the nothing scenario this 
case the deficit rises trl since the 
primary balance still deficit debt 
continues pile and fast 
what about the cabinet office scenario 
gives explicit numbers spending 
revenue however based stated 
assumptions and the trl deficit lot 
can filled reading that the 
cabinet office has spending falling from 
gdp given 
demographics this implies social spending 
per capita the elderly must fall even

about

answer the deficit would have cut about trl 
say half the overall adjustment done taxes and 
half spending cuts the result that revenues would 
rise gdp and spending would fall these 
adjustments imply consumption tax rate almost 
with exemptions and cut real benefits per capita 
for the elderly about this the scenario that

abenomics far has virtually policies promote increase participation elderly workers 
such policies must include changes retirement age and corporate labor practices neither which 
major topic recent debate inside government councils the recent report social security reform barely 
mentioned the idea raising the retirement age 
the labor debate dominated vested interests for example the labor policy council rodo seisaku 
shingikai which the ministry health labor and welfare chief forum for debating labor policy includes 
only unions represent labor even though unions include only workers moreover this council 
made business representatives who come almost entirely from big business who employ only about 
the workforce finally the academics are all from inside tokyo this commission has been agonizingly 
slow tackle the major issues broader council that meets more frequently needed order for labor 
reform proceed more aggressively 
immigration policy discussed almost entirely with respect highly skilled workers when fact 
there will much demand for lower skilled labor well 
the labor policy parts the growth strategy documents june and september most proposals remain 
vague with few notable exceptions such shifting budget resources from stopping labor movement

yes bake emissions will hardly drop all 
these results assume that 
technology progress and the pace

about the same over the last years 
population and living standards both 
grow about the same pace over the

extending these assumptions the

renewables extractables prices remain 
nearly flat while renewables prices fall

morgan stanley mufg research 
the abenomics 
november 
for model geeks how the matrices are derived 
how determine the elements the matrices the model 
the example below shows 
for transportation unit miles 
let say that the share miles provided fuel this means that the 
number miles provided fuel and electricity respectively 
say that the number miles traveled per gallon therefore the number 
gallons needed travel miles 
say that the number miles traveled per kwh therefore the number 
kwh needed travel miles 
for non transportation unit square feet served 
let say that the share sqft provided fuel this means that the 
number sqft serviced fuel and electricity respectively 
adding the fuel and electricity needs get 
matrix notation this becomes 
therefore 
similar way 
where 
the share fuel from extractables 
the share electricity from extractables 
the efficiency converting extractables electricity 
the efficiency converting extractables fuel 
the efficiency converting renewables fuel 
the efficiency converting renewables electricity 
therefore quantites energy resources quads are 
say that the number square feet services per gallon therefore the number 
gallons needed service sqft 
the story not over parameters and are engineering 
say that the number sqft serviced per kwh therefore the number 
kwh needed sevice sqft 
parameters are these are all fixed any point 
time they may evolve with technical progress course however 
the market shares and are determined relative prices 
have find method for setting the market shares based prices 
this where economics comes read 
morgan stanley mufg research 
the abenomics 
november 
for model geeks iii the market share equations 
what determines market shares the answer prices and technology 
rpm 
where the sensitivity the market share changes the relative price 
the degree sensitivity will depend many things such capital cost and other 
characteristics such ease use etc say the price mile from fuel 
that from electricity the rpm say the sensitivity coefficient 
then the market share fuel becomes 
similar procedure can used for the share fuel non transport say the 
relative price fuel for non transport that for electricity 
that fuel more expensive per square foot for non transport services 
this case rpz and the market share fuel would 
market share fuel 
for the share fuel mileage the key factor the price miles provided 
fuel relative the price miles provided electricity let say that 
the price fuel per gallon 
the price electricity per kwh 
from before know that 
the number miles per gallon 
the number miles per kwh 
therefore 
pmf 
price per mile from fuel 
pme 
price per mile from electricity 
hence the relative price miles from fuel the price miles from electricity 
rpm 
need take rpm and translate into the share miles provided fuel 
good way this the logistic function which definition ranges between 
and the case fuel for transportation the equation for market share 
market share fuel transport 
rpm price from fuel price from electricity 
where get the price fuel and the price electricity these come 
from multistep process 
take prior year prices pre determined for extractables and renewables 
apply similar procedure for market shares both fuel and electricity 
based the efficiency conversion each energy source 
fuel and electricity respectively 
apply the market share weights for extractables and renewables 
their prices and calculate the prices fuel and electricity 
thus 
summary 
short start with predetermined values and using engineering 
coefficients and market share equations calculate and using and 
along with mileage and sqft efficiency parameters calculate market shares for 
fuel and electricity providing transport and non transport services given the 
needs for transport and non transport services calculate needs for fuel and 
electricity these values determine extractables and renewables demand and 
determine prices the latter for the next year the process repeats recursively

japan energy regulatory reform source energy saving 
proposals change the regulatory structure the energy and power sectors 
have become common such changes might include 
splitting generation and transmission 
end the regional monopolies electric power generation 
promoting conversion and cycle power across the grid 
prioritize alternative energy esp solar 
natural gas for transition resource access and infrastructure build out 
judge nuclear energy full cost basis 
including costs construction decommissioning insurance nimby payments uranium cost access waste storage etc 
concentrating nuclear generation special public corporation 
smart grid and high voltage transmission 
making such changes would take enormous political commitment
