likely focus smart government safety and diversity and will 
augment abe initiatives positive impact investor sentiment 
likely 
yuriko koike insurgent ldp candidate won resounding victory over the 
official ldp candidate well over the candidate the united opposition 
parties with votes counted she took the vote 
and for the other two respectively minor candidates had taken 
the victory was broad based national broadcaster nhk reported that 
she took majority ldp voters and large share opposition party voters 
well her support was strong across both gender and age groups the victory 
was more convincing light the very large increase voter turnout 
moreover the victory reminiscent that koizumi the upper house 
election when very strong popular support gave impetus reformoriented policies which vested interests found hard resist 
the koike victory likely tailwind for abenomics one key aspect her 
campaign was the promise make tokyo smart city safe city and diverse 
city this promise likely realized her initiative enhance tokyo 
international financial center and reduce vulnerability the city potential 
earthquakes she has championed the shift power lines underground 
policy for the olympics both the grounds safety and natural 
environment she also likely push harder for tokyo expand its national 
strategic zone initiative include foreign workers household support 
alongside osaka city and kanagawa prefecture 
another key aspect her campaign was more disclosure budgets and fund 
flows the tokyo government particularly regarding the olympics popular 
opinion has already forced reconsideration the original plan for very 
expensive national stadium and further opening the olympics budget process 
will popular 
abe response likely quiet support for koike initiatives 
pointedly did not make any speeches support the official ldp candidate 
spite negative comments reportedly made about koike cabinet secretary 
yoshihide suga the benefit aggressive pro reform tokyo governor will not 
lost the abe government indeed abe political style select and 
endorse comments that promote his goals will likely see koike election 
practical opportunity

the old guard the ldp visibly unhappy with the election result but their 
position not strong especially that the ldp faction the tokyo 
metropolitan assembly the assembly members face election june 
and are unlikely block the agenda popular governor this too 
reminiscent the koizumi years many ldp diet members openly opposed both 
koizumi policies and style but they fell line when voters supported him 
koike able maintain public support similar outcome the tokyo assembly 
likely 
the election result likely means even more disarray for the opposition parties 
which could have both positive and negative impact the economic policy 
agenda the weakened opposition makes easier for abe push economic 
initiatives the same time the lack major threat from the opposition may 
embolden those the coalition who wish slow the reform agenda this 
situation augmented the decision democratic party leader katsuya okada 
not run the upcoming party leadership election 
believe that investor sentiment will improve result the election 
result koike has many characteristics that are unusual japanese politicians 
she international she speaks fluent english and arabic having gone 
college cairo university she articulate she former newscaster with 
clever sense humor she results oriented she was responsible for the 
success the cool biz initiative when she was environment minister under 
koizumi and she focused policy rather than organization she campaigned 
ideas rather than affiliation that said although the election result may 
blow wind the sails abenomics the ship must actually sail faster order 
for the economy and earnings improve and thus for markets improve
