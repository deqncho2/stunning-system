exhibit compensation per hour growth yoy 
reached our conclusion after analyzing some oddities the calculation 
method while the arithmetic the mhlw ministry health labor and 
welfare calculation correct the formula for ignores some key points 
result recommend several adjustments such use month 
moving averages compensation per hour not per worker only one 
component the mhlw metric and additional entry effect account 
for new workers the msjwwage includes all four adjustments 
comparison mhlw metric with the msjwwage startling see exhibit 
for march mhlw single month hourly compensation growth rate was 
and the month moving average was the msjwwage was 
going forward will publish monthly updates the msjwwage

the relationship between msjwwage and prices cpi excluding food and 
energy vat impact non linear see exhibit further acceleration 
msjwwage over the next year likely our view and turn would bring 
increasing increments cpi growth this further reason expect the 
debate boj tapering start soon and for the boj actually start tapering 
late once the wage trend has been confirmed action imminent 
however exhibit suggests that could take another year before the 
msjwwage has risen the point that would justify boj tapering 
investor views are dominated the mhlw index wage per worker 
particular single month figures the most recent for march has been 
revised yoy the majority investors naturally view wage growth 
paltry the msjwwage suggests otherwise this contrast implies 
asymmetric market outcome are wrong nothing changes are right

the oddities 
standard japanese wage growth metrics contain many oddities this paper analyzes the oddities and proposes 
ways tidy and give better reading wage trends 
oddity the march preliminary wage data announced the mhlw may showed general 
worker wage growth and part time worker wage growth the average the two was reported 
how can the average and 
the answer simple the shift shares employment between general and part time categories was large 
enough given the wage differential push the overall average growth rate below the growth rates both 
components exhibit gives example how this can happen time the levels compensation for 
general and part time workers start and respectively the shares the labor force are and 
respectively thus the weighted average wage 
unless otherwise stated all figures this publication refer the preliminary data announced may 
exhibit compensation growth the face large wage differences yen and 
rce rgan stan ley research 
next for time say that compensation for general and part time workers rise and respectively 
the meantime employment part time workers grows faster than that for general workers that the share 
part time workers rises under these circumstances the average compensation level rises 
rise exactly voila 
thus when there are very large differences between compensation for general workers and part time workers 
even small rise the share part timers can cause the overall compensation growth fall below the wage 
growth either worker category 
oddity the level average compensation for march listed mhlw immediately 
beside the figure for total compensation growth however the mhlw database shows the year earlier 
march compensation level was implying growth rate why the stated growth 
total compensation different from that calculated from the data 
the answer that growth based the indices published the mhlw differs from growth based the 
levels published the mhlw see exhibit for example the level compensation for all workers march 
was this compares the annual level thus the implied index 
however the mhlw reported index compensation for all workers was there are similar discrepancies 
japan economics june 
for march the resulting growth rates are very different the implied index generates growth rate while the reported index generates 
exhibit compensation levels implied indices and reported indices yen index and 
rce min istry health lab elfare cab ffice stat site 
why does this happen because the mhlw index not fact pure index but rather adjusted base 
index instead using the actual figure for wages deflate the wage levels and create index mhlw 
uses base figure japanese kijun chi which adjusts periodically the history this base figure 
derived from the reported levels wages and the reported levels the index shown exhibit there 
have been several periods when the base figure has been stable and thus does not after year stability 
distort the year year changes wages however when the base figure has changed continues change 
important separate the reported change the wage index into the parts derived from changes 
wages themselves the numerator and changes the base figure the denominator course when the 
base figure rising the wage change reported the index will below that actual wage level changes 
exhibit derived base for mhlw index compensation per worker 
rce mhlw nikkei needs rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
oddity march despite strong growth employment for both general and part time 
workers total compensation per worker fell when many people who were not working 
who had zero wages started work how could total compensation per worker fall 
new entrants the labor force typically take lower paid jobs thus larger share employment falls 
japan economics june 
paid jobs and this naturally lowers the measured average wage the employed argue that the standard 
mhlw calculation distortion because the new entrants are ignored the base period the wage 
calculation that the fact that the new entrants went from zero wage positive wage does not enter the 
mhlw calculation all the impact can seen exhibit 
exhibit average wage calculations wage per worker wage per labor force participant yen mln 
persons and 
rce rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
the exhibit starts time the labor force mln these mln are unemployed the employed 
are general workers and part timers the wage levels for the two groups are and respectively 
thus the average wage the employed 
next time the two wage rates rise and respectively however the same time half the 
unemployed get jobs albeit the low paid category thus the average wage for the employed falls 
drop seems workers are being impoverished nothing could more false 
the fault the standard calculation lies the fact that ignores zero income workers the base period this 
obvious once one calculates the average wage per labor force participant exhibit time mln people 
are earning nothing one period later one million them have jobs thus the weighted average wage per 
labor force participant goes from rise fact workers are being enriched 
the lesson clear order get accurate picture average wages entry into the labor force must 
included the wage growth formula 
japan economics june 
what done 
light these problems propose the following rules thumb for investors 
use growth rates based month moving averages because month month fluctuations 
both employment and wages due bonus payment timing prudent smooth data before calculating 
year year averages our experience suggests that month moving average best because short 
averages tend remain highly volatile 
for the growth rate wages use hourly compensation and use weighted average the growth 
rates for general workers and part time workers with weights the base period for the calculation 
for example may mhlw data imply march general worker hourly compensation including 
bonuses and part time worker hourly compensation the respective month moving 
averages were and bonuses for part time workers are nearly zero these figures translate into 
growth rates and respectively the employment weights the base period the year 
march were and thus the weighted average would 
this calculation gives the called wage part the mhlw overall growth rate see appendix for the 
algebra note that the difference between the wage part and mhlw overall growth rate can very large 
this phenomenon arises because even relatively small changes labor share between full and part timers are 
turbo charged the final mhlw calculation when there are large differences average pay 
augment the wage part with the entry effect because entry into the labor force people 
previously earning zero will impact the average wage recommend adding element the wage part 
mentioned above the calculation simple income per labor force participant equals the income per 
employee multiplied the ratio employment the labor force that taking the 
growth rate and ignoring the cross term this becomes that recommend 
taking the wage part from above for and adding 
but there twist the mhlw data not include figures for the labor force thus recommend use the 
employment growth rate and labor force growth rate from the statistics bureau ministry information and 
communications mics rodo ryoku chosa the labor force survey for example the growth 
employment the months march was and that the labor force thus one would add 
the wage part from above the months march get

what really happening wages and what does mean for boj 
our calculations more accurate indicators wage trends japan are presented exhibit 
the news good despite bumps the wage part compensation per hour was growing about end 
the run the consumption tax increase the tax hike pushed hourly wage growth down about 
but wage growth soon began revive moved above november and most recently 
recorded march recently the wage part has moderated but remains above 
the entry effect has remained positive throughout this period and has kept the overall msjwwage 
more more recently the entry effect while still positive has waned but the overall msjwwage march was 
view the recent moderation both the wage part and the entry part temporary light base 
effects from rapid growth the consumption tax hike last year 
note also that the growth real compensation per hour based the cpi excluding fresh food the boj 
preferred indicator has improved recent months although still negative when the consumption tax hike 
april falls out the comparison the data announcement for april the growth rate real 
compensation per hour should turn significantly positive 
exhibit compares our preferred wage metrics with those the mhlw the ministry prefers emphasize 
growth rates based the wage indexes and use these for comparison order compare like like 
list the growth rates moving averages the mhlw indexes along with the growth rates 
there are two key conclusions first both mhlw and the msjwwage show upward trends wage per hour 
second our metrics both the wage part alone and the msjwwage total lie significantly above those 
mhlw stick our view that wage growth remains upward path and that the upward path higher 
than consensus 
exhibit compensation per hour growth yoy 
rce mhlw maikin kei rgan stan ley research calcu latio 
japan economics june 
these trends have important implications for both monetary policy and for markets first the boj has 
emphasized the movement hourly wages because its relationship measured inflation since even mhlw 
calculations show upward movement hourly compensation growth boj can credibly claim the 
right track exiting inflation our calculations strengthen this claim the msjwwage about points 
higher than its counterpart moving average the mhlw metric the boj that much closer seeing 
wage growth sufficient exit deflation 
investor views are dominated the mhlw index wage per worker particular the bumpy one month 
figures the most recent these was initially announced may but now has been revised 
seems only natural that the majority investors view wage growth paltry our metrics suggest 
otherwise this result implies asymmetric market outcome are wrong nothing changes are right 
there will likely major change inflation expectations japan with impact forex equity and bond 
markets 
continue think that the trend wages upward and that japan will indeed exit deflation with 
concomitant impact boj policy action imminent however exhibit above showed how the 
msjwwage related the cpi food and energy vat impact could well take another year before the 
msjwwage has risen the point that would justify boj confidence reducing monetary stimulus thus 
contrary the investor consensus stick our view that the next boj move will tapering although most 
likely not until autumn

appendix 
this appendix decompose the mhlw wage growth metric into three parts the first the wage part this 
part simply weighted average the wage growth rates the two types labor the weights are their 
respective shares total employment note that the employment shares refer the base period the 
calculation 
the second part adjustment for wage disparities this part also weighted average wage growth 
the two types labor but the weights are different this second part the weights involve both employment 
shares and adjustment for the difference the wage for each type versus the average and 
the third part adjustment for the change labor shares between the base period and the current period 
includes yet another weighted average wage growth for the two types labor but the weights this time are 
the relative disparities and practice these two elements are very small the extra element inside the 
brackets the difference between and premium wage general workers relative the average less 
the discount part timers this element can large and acts turbo charge the effect employment 
share changes the overall mhlw calculation when there are large differences wage between the two
