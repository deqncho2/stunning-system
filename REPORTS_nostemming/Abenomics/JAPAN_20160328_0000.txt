japanese corporate governance embarking transformative phase 
rce rgan stan ley research 
embarking transformative phase the history japanese corporate governance history 
corporate ownership 
the first piece legislation regarding corporate ownership japan was the former commercial code 
which established the general shareholders meeting the highest decision making body for companies 
and under which there were boards directors boards directors arrived when enshrined into japanese 
law basically inherited from corporate law then came the broad transfer powers from the 
general shareholders meeting the board directors but ensuing scandals led the introduction 
two layer oversight system auditing officers and board directors subsequently the requirements 
auditing officers were tightened but the role boards tended tilted more toward business execution than 
oversight style system companies with committees was established and model created 
whereby the majority committee members would external directors but few companies actively adopted 
this saw the formation companies with audit and other committees with eye utilizing outside 
directors more active roles that some companies have switched this format end january 
marks progress toward greater board independence companies with auditing officers and companies with 
committees may also advance independence but companies with audit and other committees have the 
advantage reducing the onus the company itself the last years have seen powers decision making 
with regard management japanese companies shift from shareholders boards directors and 
those responsible for business execution process that has also tested skills the oversight department 
believe corporate governance reforms are now embarking the fourth phase written with reference shoji

morgan stanley approach esg research 
governance key factor determining how company performs poor practice may mean business 
decisions are made that are not shareholders best interests whereas robust practice should ensure that 
management aligned with shareholder value creation the long term there are number areas that fall 
under the governance umbrella but would suggest that investors focus board composition alignment 
with minority shareholders and executive compensation recognise that corporate governance codes best 
practice vary between countries such investors should examine company governance policies within the 
context the country which listed 
iven the major reforms that have been introduced over the last few years governance japan 
particularly unique case consider the proprietary japan corporate governance score aims help 
investors understand how japanese companies are performing comparing them range governance 
metrics there are twenty items included the corporate governance score with maximum score 
achievable 
makes sense invest companies that are demonstrating best class governance capabilities those that 
are travelling the right direction indeed investing anticipation success could prove fruitful 
strategy the ability the company generate cash value also fundamental though and the linking 
together these two factors that makes the morgan stanley japan research team approach governance 
analysis unique 
governance one three pillars that make sustainable and responsible investment 
research morgan stanley with the other two being environment and social factors working alongside stock 
analysts the global team focused analyzing the impact environmental social and governance 
factors share prices 
believe that understanding and risks and opportunities can only enhance investment 
decisions such this added layer analysis should relevant and interesting for all investors whether 
not they have sri mandate traditional investment analysis requires assessment company accounts 
industry dynamics and the politico economic outlook investors should also consider number broader 
factors when making investment decisions and our framework provides toolbox that can enhance 
traditional financial analysis for more information please see embedding sustainability into valuation

for the respective industries and the rationale 
financial services industry average cash roe stated profit goodwill amortization costs adjustments for 
insurers stated shareholders equity year end there are cases where stated profits can pushed down 
due accounting treatment also adjusted for this our numerator for the denominator since unlike 
many other industries cash flow not financial cash flow but part operating cash flow think stated 
shareholder equities year end better yardstick cash flow for shareholders make our comparisons 
over three and five years given the large degree noise created the booking losses the wake the 
global financial crisis 
foods cosmetics household products use operating cash flow opcf divided invested capital 
shareholders equity interest bearing debt because cash generation power important metric simple 
representation brand value and believe this measure better suited comparisons than roe being 
little affected goodwill amortization and extraordinary losses and able avoid skews evaluation that 
could result from surplus cash look the average values for the seven years since the global financial crisis 
and for the most recent three years 
metals trading use three criteria operating cash earnings net profit depreciation and 
ebitda equity method investment earnings addition the importance cash flow when considering 
enterprise value believe management resource allocation from long term perspective especially 
important given that the business involves products with relatively long lifecycle returns capital employed 
can realized variety ways and should also factor the negative returns writedowns and similar 
cases that are excluded from cash flow items and when assessing investment returns for the time period 
look the seven years after the global financial crisis

the companies selected were early movers respect tightening governance arrangements 
and meet many the scoring criteria for example almost all have implemented all the principles set out 
the corporate governance code ratios external directors and non executive directors are both high all have 
introduced standards for results based compensation nevertheless financial services general have come 
for criticism that weightings results based compensation are too high there need for balance too 
although daiwa securities group provides specific profit targets such and roe many offer ambiguous 
explanations the subject results linked compensation that standards apply vary depending earnings

scores can increased making the provisions noted for separating duties directors and

the exhibit compares and plots average cash roe the past three years and governance scores cash roe 
defined 
stated profit goodwill amortization costs adjustments for insurers stated shareholders equity yearend 
there are formats where stated profit under gaap can come out lower than economic profit the stated 
numbers insurers for example can depressed special reserve provisioning provisioning not for 
specified items but for reserves retained nature also adjusted for this our calculations cash 
roe whereas many other industries operating cash flow cash flow statements tends the main 
yardstick for returns financial services cash flow from deposits loans etc not financial cash flow but part 
operating cash flow think method that adds back gains costs relating goodwill amortization stated 
profit provides better view cash flow for shareholders than cash flow based statements the usual 
style 
since all the formats with varying adjustments essentially take stated profit based approach investor 
rewards policy yearly cash flow from the perspective shareholders dividends and share buybacks 
affected levels stated profit hence need consider whether governance conducted such way 
that leads improved levels cash roe 
the exhibit plots averages for the past three years and the past five years the three year averages cover the 
period boj monetary policy expansion quantitative easing the time the abe administration while the 
five year averages incorporate the previous cycle using seven year averages the same way the sections

relatively stable high cash roe has been recorded both the last three and the last five years 
major banks mizuho smfg both periods saw the domestic credit cycle burden credit costs work 
favor earnings and high stable contributions profit levels from growth overseas operations and stock 
market recovery yet maintaining high roe levels the credit cycle cycles through and tougher capital 
regulations reduce capital efficiency calls for greater discipline financial affairs and flexible organizational 
response the changes our scorings are based the situation end and think monitoring 
changes that could improve scoring has role play determining the sustainability earnings 
performances 
how does proactive governance impact earnings performance 
profit levels financial service formats are significantly impacted the economic and regulatory climates 
even think that management oversight and expeditious and optimal allocation management resources 
resulting from tighter governance can even formats that are vulnerable effects changes external 
conditions afford differentiation among peers terms raised levels profit stability growth potential and 
returns capital 
while there appears some correlation between current scorings and past cash roe there are also 
companies that earn high scores but whose cash roe not all that high have already noted that business 
earnings these formats can swing widely depending the economic climate but differences within subindustries can also observed where improvement roe has been hampered past delays addressing 
allocation management resources the revenue mix inability control the absolute scale the 
capital base whether because mistakes emphasis securing certain amount profit growth 
for companies that already score highly jgs and where there some clarity the issues address 
notably orix and nomura see potential for future improvement earnings performance 
orix positioned close the edges the first and second quadrants what does need address 
orix has increased its profit the past three years but sizeable retained earnings too have meant that average 
cash roe has not been high relative terms new investment and business performance from here stand 
determine whether the high level profit growth the firm has seen now sustainable while this 
supports the view that needs have certain amount retained earnings also arguably needs 
continually monitor the balance with shareholder return here too think checks and advice provided 
external directors could alter orix corporate behavior including how perceived the stock market 
what does nomura need tackle elsewhere facing smaller revenue pie overseas wholesale 
japan corporate governance march 
business and particularly global ficc bond business nomura allocated resources with the goal 
expanding market share but the resulting revenue growth was not enough cover the cost base 
consequently although profit nomura too has staged big recovery from post financial crisis levels the 
absolute level has not kept with those other financial service formats the company reviewing resource 
allocation and working trim the cost base response the changing conditions faces but 
continue reviewing and updating resource allocation operating conditions evolve surely the need for board 
oversight and wisdom will only increase think the key here will selection board members with 
diversity industry well regional experience and the ability advise even without specialist 
knowledge the business how the firm can organize and run itself respond nimbly changes well 
the areas marketing and compliance 
major banks insurers progress with separating the roles executive officers and directors pursuing further 
diversity strengthen oversight relation overseas business expansion and also need consider 
improvements that can underscore management commitment the area compensation schemes 
exhibit financial services continuing lack transparency investor rewards and visibility changes 
the regulatory environment suggest big changes are unlikely the short run but scope for market view

high scores for shiseido and calbee are worth noting many score around the average the average 
corporate governance score for these consumer goods industries came out with many companies the 
range these industries can hardly described proactive the areas external directors beefing 
oversight functions and the high proportion near average scores effect the difficulty awarding 
differentiated scores turn think the lack proactiveness board reforms reflects that fact that many 
the firms have long histories brand based business affords operating stability and some the 
companies are owner run suntory kikkoman kose unicharm and others have particular shareholder setups shares are held the government yakult founding goes back alliance domestic 
distribution companies this setting the scores shiseido and calbee stand out note that our 
corporate governance scores reflect conditions and not factor any changes from 
jan 
shiseido advanced governance excluding some scores such for short incumbency the president 
shiseido generally comes out with high scores all items under shinzo maeda ceo president from 
chairman returned president the company pursued highly transparent 
approach governance and has covered yet more ground under president uotani corporate reforms from 
examples superior governance shiseido include three the six member board directors are 
independent outside directors from jan four seven directors are appointed from outside the firm 
the presence three women among directors and auditing officers points attention diversity from jan 
four women out directors auditing officers external directors terms duty are long seven 
years the firm discloses compensation schemes for internal directors and executive officers schemes have 
changed jan but disclosed details this well its summary financial statements and 
former president maeda did not stay chairman following his retirement though unrelated our scoring 
here the firm corporate governance report was also the longest our industry sample running pages 
and answers were thoughtfully considered moreover when president uotani was brought external 
appointment was selected from among three candidates nominations advisory committee officers 
made mainly external directors through process that involved interviews exchange management 
views etc uotani was advisor shiseido the time but was not made aware his interviews that 
was candidate for the presidency the firm proactive proponent diversity too its ratio female leaders 
japan was mar but the company noted its corporate governance report that aims for 
during 
calbee has instituted governance reports under chairman matsumoto could pioneering 
example proactive governance calbee score was but suffered the following areas and think 
can viewed more favorably than the bald figure suggests its score was penalized because none the 
outside directors have specialist background financial affairs accountancy legal affairs its score here was 
zero average incumbency independent external directors short effect four out five external 
directors having been replaced apr and the company has public target for roe though even 
without target roe arguably high calbee has been actively pursuing governance reforms 
under ceo chairman akira matsumoto who took his post jun areas where stands out particular 
for governance include aside from ceo chairman matsumoto and coo president shuji ito the sixmember board consists four independent external directors five until oct when outside director 
anindita mukherjee from major shareholder pepsico stood down upon her resignation from pepsico the 
firm gives consideration diversity selecting one woman each outside director and outside audit 
supervisory board members and the ratio results based compensation the chairman and the 
president total compensation over its corporate governance report calbee wrote that the role 
the board ensure unbiased management structure informed broader range perspectives and 
independent standpoints its decision making that may more effectively promote innovation and new 
value creation aims not only for clear division between business execution and oversight but utilize 
external directors competent advisory capacity hence its lineup external directors features kikkoman 
chairman emeritus yuzaburo mogi hitachi senior advisor toshio kawamura and unicharm president ceo 
takahisa takahara who bring wealth management experience would describe its governance truly 
proactive calbee too actively pursuing diversity its female leader ratio japan was apr 
but higher than four years ago along with raising the ratio the end the company aims 
stated its corporate governance report too have women account for domestic staff apr 
japan corporate governance march 
ajinomoto kao and unicharm are seen well run companies but earn relatively low scores reasons 
and scope for improvement are varied but would not describe governance quality poor 
ajinomoto leader the food industry terms measures for improving enterprise value including 
target for total shareholder return average over the three years its medium term plan and its holding the 
first esg briefing the consumer goods space albeit that the focus the and components kao 
incorporates eva into how runs its business and putting efficient management into practice roe was high 
for and the firm has also raised its dividend for years running unicharm successful 
company that has grown rapidly under president ceo takahara the last years and offers total 
shareholder return yearly basis and yet corporate governance scores were below the average 
for all three firms for ajinomoto for kao and for unicharm ajinomoto large board made 
members with three external directors and its overall score was depressed the large number directors 
serving concurrently executive officers the low weighting female officers one external director one 
external auditing officer well the president and directors short terms service though not reflecting 
the score directors two year terms office also put the minority the picture similar unicharm 
only two its large member board are external directors both whom also serve external auditing 
officers and average age including president takahara most directors also have executive officer 
roles and there are female board members unicharm has successfully grown owner run firm under 
the leadership and management vision president takahara and effectively drawing the resources 
highly capable officers its corporate governance report too referred business activities implemented 
integrating management and executive divisions could that successful owner run companies with 
distinctive family run corporate culture are simply not suited this kind scoring kao meanwhile has board 
six members seven from jan whom three are external directors even with two independent 
directors female directors and short service terms directors its score has been depressed there seems 
need for further improvements the board areas such diversity but not think governance 
poor the score suggests given the capable presence figures like management consultant sonosuke 
kadonaga among the roll external directors 
kose score high but would not call progressive open governance kose score which 
the next highest score shiseido and calbee its strong score reflects the long tenures the company 
president and directors the presence woman the board the previous president not being the board 
and the holding stake president kazutoshi kobayashi however the case owner run 
unicharm there are still some doubts regarding the governance structure there are members the board 
including just one external director attorney iwao toigawa there are two external auditors the board does not 
have compensation committee other advisory committees nevertheless while most the companies 
manage achieve non zero ratio females the board only appointing woman external board 
member worth noting that the lone female board member kose was internally promoted 
kirin holdings score the lowest but management reforms are likely push its score around 
average levels kirin score the only company with score the fifties the low score 
reflects short tenures among the president and directors the low percentage independent directors and the 
absence women the board still the company has undertaken some major changes its governance 
structure since jan and expect its score rise three nine board members were external 
directors but chairman senji miyake stepped down the number external directors will increase four from 
out the total nine board members furthermore external director toshio arima has been designated 
board chairman and kimie iwata joining the board external director details regarding director 
compensation are not clear either but the company plans tie compensation more closely the achievement 
medium term targets such roe and eps and share price taking such changes into account think 
kirin score could increase around points line with the overall average 
issues going forward include positions external directors and third parties how companies use their 
external directors likely become issue still the case that companies generally tap lawyers university 
professors and former executives financial institutions for the role and external directors are minority 
kao and kirin since jan are the only companies our sample where external director acts board 
chairman kikkoman out board members there are three external directors but these are former boj 
governor toshihiko fukui former mof official mamoru ozaki and former president and chairman

provide corporate governance link its homepage kirin also has link present but plans add 
before the end mar owner run companies generally have their own distinctive cultures and systems that 
have driven their growth and can understand why they are not inclined take progressive approach 
toward corporate governance reforms however think there room for improvement and look frank and 
open discussions diversity issue too think using the talents female executives big part the 
longer term plans shiseido calbee and kao and anticipate strategic moves this direction asahi and 
kirin are among companies that have clarified numerical targets for women management their business

sort companies into the following four broad groups high scores for both governance and opcf calbee 
below average governance scores but high opcf levels kao unicharm high governance scores 
but below average opcf shiseido broadly average governance scores and opcf levels cannot

companies which deserve the first category combining strong governance with business 
performance are those where makes sense invest for the medium and long term

calbee and kao combine cash generation power with governance calbee and score well 
corporate governance and cash generation power kao and unicharm come out relatively low governance 
and relatively high cash generation opcf levels over the past three years are high each case calbee 
kao unicharm and these companies all have business models that earn operating 
margins more than calbee has set operating margin goal its medium term plan and 
targeting growth sales and each year pre eminent high growth high earnings 
company helped the lucrative model the tobacco industry itself but exploiting marketing 
power and technology capability achieve strong growth and profitability overseas its corporate governance 
score but would top the impact the government owning stake was excluded kao has built 
high earning model japan backed direct marketing systems the domestic household products market 
and strong market share noted kao corporate governance score below average but not regard its 
actual governance quality poor 
kose the basis our outlook would join the same category calbee and can 
problematic link assessment owner run companies with corporate governance ratings unicharm 
has high opcf but relatively low corporate governance score meanwhile kose has average opcf 
only the past three years but under our forecasts this rises for and for with 
cash generation power rising markedly also scores for corporate governance this measures well 
against calbee and and would not unreasonable put kose the bucket firms that combine strong 
governance with business performance however noted questions marks over kose governance 
structure remain both unicharm and kose under owner presidents have achieved growth with distinctive 
corporate style management philosophy and talent development our sense that evaluate these firms 
using corporate governance ratings problematic and the same can said suntory which also 
owner run 
shiseido evaluation will hinge how performs from here shiseido has seen its brand power wane 
since and internal structural problems have contributed stagnant earnings has served good 
example how strong governance not necessarily linked business performance however under current 
ceo masahiko uotani shiseido has been making bold corporate reforms margins through will not 
impressive because revitalization the brand currently the priority but see future potential although 
hitting the company long term vision more than for the guidance 
may not easy not think the screening result here proper reflection shiseido position 
japan corporate governance march 
focus points ahead shiseido kirin reforms dividend policy and potential changes familyowned corporations 
highlight shiseido management style which unlike other japanese corporations management 
reforms shiseido are already having some impact domestically revamping overseas business however 
remains major issue shiseido has just started with regional headquarter format which divided into the 
americas europe china asia pacific and travel retail divisions the americas europe and travel retail have 
regional heads that are non japanese and have been recruited externally while these regional heads are 
neither board directors nor executive officers they hold significant authority and are believed have high 
incentive based compensation this has been bold move much the spirit president uotani appointing 
regional heads from outside and suntory are among the other companies that give overseas managing 
authority local heads however both cases was simply matter acquired company business 
maintaining its authority post acquisition and these companies have been able grow further merely not 
disrupting these acquired businesses going beyond the board director executive officer framework and 
tapping into high quality outside personnel reform the company shiseido rare among japanese 
corporates though experiment that indeed carries risk successful think shiseido can viewed 
new corporate governance model for japan 
kirin aiming also overhaul low earning businesses corporate governance evolves 
mentioned kirin has been appointing more outsiders the board directors chairman the board and 
has increasingly linked bonuses for the board and corporate executives earnings other words the 
company has increasingly connected executive bonuses quantitative medium term targets roe eps 
attainment company guidance operating profit and the stock price however appears that bonuses 
were cut sharply for employees the domestic beverages business where earnings struggled last 
year the new medium term plan announced feb aims revamp poor earning businesses those being kirin 
beverage the australian beverage business and brasil kirin the company has also said various briefings that 
these business revamps prove unsuccessful could the medium long term look radically reshuffle its 
portfolio selling integrating these with other companies while there are still too many unknowns say 
whether kirin revitalization plans will pay off these should highly watched source corporate value 
hope that jt shift dividend policy spurs other food companies jt dividend policy aimed 
boost the payout ratio least which the company achieved and now targeting constant 
dividend hikes for onward aligned with earnings growth what jt new dividend policy signifies 
investors that the company will boost dividends commensurate with eps growth basis that strips out 
forex impact jt earnings are highly weighted overseas businesses leaving earnings vulnerable 
such likely hike dividends even times hits which appears appealing especially income 
funds and medium long term investors stocks the food industry saw multiples jump and 
has become less likely that share buybacks can bolster roe levels hope that other companies will follow the 
example bolstering shareholder return policies leveraging dividends particular case this point 
potential for change well family owned corporations when meeting with overseas investors 
unicharm president takahara and reps apparently are increasingly asked pressed corporate governance 
think such voices reflect not just the impact the corporate governance code but also investors opinion 
the that the company issued last sep pola orbis did two years ago turning its focus roe and 
hiking the dividend payout see potential for corporate governance reforms move onto the radar 
family owned companies well 
some companies still have high levels policy shareholdings policy shareholdings shareholdings for 
other than pure investment purposes remain quite prevalent the food industry including yakult kirin 
kikkoman and ajinomoto along with dismantling cross shareholdings think policy shareholdings could

how does proactive governance affect companies earnings performance 
evaluation return track record metals trading companies manufacturers have generated 
reasonably high returns overall while trading companies have delivered low returns the four 
manufacturers discuss nippon steel sumitomo metal jfe holdings sumitomo metal mining sumitomo 
electric industries have delivered investment returns the past seven years that each the measures 
consider opcf ebitda equity method appear exceed their cost capital indicating that 
management resources have been allocated ways that are accretive for the business environment for 
materials industries over the seven years from has actually been adverse overall during period 
turbulence featuring the recovery from the upheaval the global financial crisis cratering demand 
due the great east japan earthquake and thai flooding and plunging commodity prices 
from the end the exchange rate was also volatile with yen strength giving way weakness while 
conditions for exports and smelting margins improved the cost imported raw materials also rose and from 
macro standpoint this did not necessarily raise baseline profitability think important note that these 
have been the conditions for fundamentals which the above outcomes have been recorded 
turning the details the top terms opcf smm with the two blast furnace steel makers and 
sei the range terms and ebitda equity method the two nonferrous companies 
rank higher with double digit returns and the two blast furnace steel makers also meaningfully exceed 
manufacturing industries this period has seen lot rationalization restructuring activity with the nippon 
steel sumitomo metal merger and production consolidation including large scale scrapping capacity and 
writedowns the primary objective investment projects has been skewed towards building base 
facilities and investing rationalization and efficiency rather than capacity expansion per and 
encouraging that this area particular investments occurred with high probability securing returns 
terms cost cutting effects 
also note that deterioration during this period for blast furnace steelmakers has included extensive 
inventory losses trend that has been particularly pronounced the last three years the two major 
steelmakers have seen opcf returns far excess the two nonferrous companies returns 
meanwhile trading companies investment returns look have been below capital costs all 
measures opcf and ebitda equity method although mitsui and itochu 
relatively have realized reasonably high returns our analysis suggests that business resource allocation the 
case all companies has led down the path erosion even looking opcf which does not capture 
non cash factors such writedowns equity method earnings mitsui and itochu have only matched 
modestly exceeded capital costs while meager returns for sojitz sumitomo corp and mitsubishi have 
been still more challenged suggesting particularly major issues from the standpoint cash generation power 
during the first phase this period trading companies favored opportunities expand earnings building 
assets and although the latter phase with resource prices falling they have given more consideration 
the balance between investment and asset replacement and sought shift the balance capital overinvested 
resource fields into non resource areas would say that they have yet move decisively directions that 
enhance all important 
verifying how standing corporate governance has has not translated into track record 
returns hard identify quantitative correlation between corporate governance ratings and return 
invested business resources but based the judgments the coverage analysts have qualitatively looked 
whether front foot governance has worked effectively 
mitsui the highest scorer jgs the industry may have seen support from from the board 
function observer monitor incentives produce earnings results and investment decisions 
made from specialist standpoint return analysis mitsui compares very poorly with our manufacturing 
companies but comes out top within the trading company industry the company governance systems have 
been advanced the standard the industry while cannot claim that every aspect has functioned 
japan corporate governance march 
properly would say that from the standpoints the board directors observer function performance 
incentives and use expert opinions making investment decisions mitsui governance may have been 
supportive for relative the situation peers the requirement now deploy governance systems and 
functions more effectively rather than simply having them available and see the observer function and 
specialized expertise particularly important checks and balances for investment decisions what matters 
that this should improve the vector investment returns and feed greater stock market confidence earnings 
sojitz sumitomo and mitsubishi rank low for returns failure relatively high governance scores 
particularly for mitsubishi and sojitz lead results calls for examination whether systems have 
been place form only not substance while can objected that the low returns the trading 
company industry are attributable simply commodity prices resource energy fields what show the 
outcome relative comparison and furthermore cumulative analysis for seven year period suggesting 
that this not simply opinion based hindsight but rather the result management decisions analysis 
based opcf excluding writedowns and other non cash factors also shows the same trend noted 
indicating that invested capital has generally not delivered the requisite returns and pointing the need 
examine how the governance structure has contributed the state the investment strategy and how 
improve its efficacy for front foot governance approach translate effectively into improved future 
think there room for still stronger monitoring mechanisms and better use specialized opinions when 
deciding how allocate business resources 
nssm and jfe scored poorly jgs but came out well analysis investment returns yet both 
have had book large writedowns tens billion yen overseas industry conditions worsened 
and need review management resource allocation with view bolstering governance 
enhancing observer function etc the steel industry plant intensive industry has heavy depreciation 
burden and over the last several years the industry has been exposed large and ongoing falls raw 
materials prices making massive inventory valuation losses unavoidable result although this seems 
differ from the market impression based opcf well ebitda equity method 
believe the two firms have conducted management decisions that ultimately led improved 
viewed globally the steel industry has seen balance sheets deteriorate due overinvestment and sluggish 
earnings but the situation for japan steelmakers different they have seen opcf expand via earnings 
recovery and made progress reducing overall interest bearing debt leading significant balance sheet 
improvement their investment has not primarily been expansionary nature directed acquisitions 
capacity expansion but aimed instead rationalizing and raising efficiency think this the difference 
specifically the main expansion overseas has been areas such building new supply sources for automotive 
steel sheets and large scale acquisition roller facilities domestic manufacturing sites firms have been 
investing update old facilities and rationalization efficiency investing refurbishment alongside capacity 
streamlining suspension blast furnace operations etc realistically course not everything undertaken 
the two japanese majors has gone well and there have been cases major writedowns overseas running into 
the tens billions yen and large investment projects that have done nothing raise the stock market 
earnings expectations the lesson being that allocating management resources there always the need 
test whether this aimed the right direction 
think nssm has lot room for improvement relation the observer monitoring function separation 
management and execution weighting independent external directors advancing diversity etc well 
putting systems place that more decisions are taken with the input professional opinions further 
building mechanisms that strengthen commitment business performance urgent priority extending 
the tenure board members and bolstering incentives would also like see the takeover defense 
measures revised early stage 
focus companies with more nimble capital policy based track record investment returns 
balance sheet quality latitude cash flow etc well those with potential for change these 
areas has brought progress marubeni nssm and sumitomo metal mining watch itochu for 
moves toward improving jgs securing improvement stepping governance securing efficiency 
free cash flow and providing clear indications management resource allocation and capital policy key 
theme which the stock market has high expectations think reasons for this include that major 
japan corporate governance march 
progress improving balance sheet quality has pushed reducing interest bearing debt down the list 
priorities and affords companies more freedom how they utilize funds that the main macro scenario has 
shifted from one high global growth driven ems one low growth with variations region and 
the need for more selective approach investment going forward expectations returns from simple 
investment growth boosted capacity diminish

discloses the basis for calculating director compensations discloses results based equation for 
fixed and earnings linked compensation and framework design for compensation shares 
from the above perspective when disclosing compensation system design value transparency the

from the above perspective and given the issue short tenure managers japanese firms noted 
assess disclosure share compensation schemes needed instill long term incentives particularly from the 
same perspective investors our target for the proportion non independent directors for whom share 
compensation disclosed western firms there are noticeable number cases where independent 
directors also receive share compensation but japanese companies the foundations are not yet place for 
debating the merits that 
gross director compensation past three year average operating 
widely known that the compensation managers low japanese firms compared with western firms 
japan corporate governance march 
however surveys key figures point out the practices japanese firms such executive officers going 
serve directors then after retirement moving subsidiaries becoming advisors consultants such that 
the lifetime compensation managers japanese companies may not differ from the average managers 
western firms also related the discussion above there are various nebulous incentives address and 
also ultimately the interest investors enhance the incentives managers receive from their active 
duties our target for doubling director compensation japanese firms which only about 
operating cash flow over the last three years assign cases within range and for others 
for the same reasons coverage where director compensation disclosed
