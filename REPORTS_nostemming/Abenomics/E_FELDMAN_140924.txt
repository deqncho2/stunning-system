investors want small government results the japan fiscal 
reform survey 
fiscal reform back too 
fiscal reform back the agenda the easy part comes 
december when abe faces dilemma whether 
implement the next tranche points the scheduled 
consumption tax hike hikes risks significant 
economic decline delays risks significant bond 
market decline think most likely that will implement 
the hike but also adopt economic support measures such 
pressing for more boj easing modest spending high return 
projects more aggressive corporate tax cut and accelerated 
structural reforms 
the hard parts come after the consumption tax decision the 
consensus japanese opinion now understands that 
consumption tax will not enough close the fiscal deficits 
indeed the mof fiscal commission has calculated that even 
with the consumption tax further adjustment about 
gdp would needed achieve debt sustainability 
the first hard choice how much the remaining fiscal 
adjustment should come tax hikes and spending cuts 
even after this hard choice two equally hard ones await 
how should the composition government spending 
which about now spent social security different 
types changed how should the composition 
government revenue which about now direct taxes 
income different types changed 
get reading investor opinions these three hard 
choices conducted investor survey see appendix for 
actual questions asked and for demographic characteristics 
the respondents the average respondent was male 
middle aged with substantial income and had never had 
serious illness important remember that the survey was 
conducted among investors only and thus that the 
characteristics survey respondents differ significantly from 
the average the population
