privatization could accelerate economic growth 
but there are three conditions the 
privatization program must very large the 
proceeds privatization must used for 
other third arrow reforms tax reform 
labor laws etc must improve the response 
productivity growth 
spending control finally the agenda privatization 
the government will implement public service reforms 
which aim for more efficient administrative work and 
privatization 
but how much can privatization actually contribute fiscal 
reform the answer depends not only the proceeds but 
what they are used for 
watch out for the denominator 
the fiscal debate learns arithmetic 
the debate fiscal reform heating heretofore the 
working assumption behind most public discussion has been 
tax hikes will sufficient solve the fiscal problem the 
logic was simple each point hike the consumption tax 
would add about trl tax revenue aging adds about 
trl social spending each year therefore taking the 
consumption tax from about would add trl 
revenue about enough pay for aging 
the flaw this argument simple even true the resulting 
tax revenues would consumed entirely extra spending 
and would leave the annual borrowing requirement about 
trl the current level deficits would continue accumulate 
and fiscal sustainability would never achieved 
fortunately the fiscal debate has now gone beyond this 
innocent simplicity indeed the government most recent 
thick boned report stated 
social security benefits japan are constantly increasing 
rate higher than that economic growth amid further 
declining birthrate and aging population necessary 
review social security benefits including the called 
natural increase with focus healthcare and nursing 
care 
colleagues suggest below there are divergent estimates 
for the proceeds that may expected from privatization the 
low end non obligatory holdings equities the central 
government totaled trl see below japan recent 
privatization policy trend and abenomics exhibit the 
unrealistically high end december holdings fixed 
assets the general government national accounts concept 
including central government local governments and the social 
security fund consolidated totaled trl their shares and 
other equities trl the fixed assets public sector entities 
outside the general government trl and shares and other 
equities such entities trl for total trl see below 
investor guide japanese government balance sheet data 
exhibit addition there are other government entities that 
are treated private sector firms the national accounts 
thus there very broad band for potential privatization 
proceeds the next question how much the potential 
proceeds however estimated will made available after all 
there are some entities that one would ever consider 
privatizing the bank japan the decision how much 
privatize will depend political and economic conditions 
abenomics moves forward 
addition there the question whether the potential 
resources are large small relative the job hand 
course whether number big small depends what you 
compare let make some comparisons exhibit

privatization and productivity growth 
the ultimate impact privatization the fiscal balance 
depends far more how privatization affects productivity 
growth than the proceeds relative tax revenue after all 
privatization proceeds are one off events but productivity 
growth ongoing the historical experience with privatization 
across countries has been very diverse and depends many 
variables other than privatization per however the general 
conclusion summarized luintel khan and theodoridis

how could privatization contribute rise the share

ongoing very aggressive program privatization would 
needed should the presumed proceeds japan post stock

number years very large share the funds needed for

the indirect contributions could much larger however 
seen privatization programs such ntt and the 
the shift the private sector makes firms far more 
sensitive efficient performance key element course 
the adoption new technology one example would the 
jr introduction the suica card wireless electronic ticket 
that now widely accepted electronic money not only for 
tickets but convenience stores vending machines and other 
points sale beyond the confines stations moreover 
when shifted electronic tickets did other railways and 
now the systems have been unified thus saving costs for both 
the railways and the riders 
addition and privatization could made more effective 
with more aggressive stance third arrow structural 
reforms the examples potential airport privatization 
particularly that kitakyushu airport discussed below 
airports example pfis are particularly suggestive 
implication these examples that government assets 
need not sold outright order improve efficiency and 
contribute both fiscal reform and growth indeed the focus 
concessions selling utilization and operation rights 
public assets such airports without selling the assets 
themselves key initiative this idea not new but has 
accelerated sharply under abenomics 
such initiatives are quiet but crucial the economics business 
investment japan could improve sharply with more 
aggressive third arrow policies such changes corporate 
tax laws labor laws immigration laws agricultural laws and 
social welfare rules such third arrow changes would likely 
raise the impact productivity growth and thus give 
any privatization program more bang for the buck 
how privatization proceeds are used spur and thus 
raise productivity growth will determine the bang the degree 
privatization will determine the bucks the topic that

reforming public services the basic policy fiscal and

furthermore the government council for private finance 
initiative pfi promotion targets the concession type 
privatization six airports only three years 
hitherto the operation and administration airports has been 
under state control the government uses special account for 
maintaining state run airports and for subsidizing the 
maintenance regionally managed airports assisted the 
efforts the government council for pfi promotion airport 
concessions became possible with the enactment 
legislation for the operation state run airports and other 
facilities using the private sector this legislation states that 
airport concession arrangements are possible for state run 
airports regionally managed airports civil aviation facilities 
shared airports and other airports established and 
administered regional public bodies 
concession benefits what benefits are likely stem from 
airport concessions expect benefits the following two 
main areas first the concession system should enable efficient 
airport operation granting the operating company the 
authority decide the fees charged for example for landing 
according the ministry land infrastructure transport and 
tourism mlit draft legislation the operation state run 
airports and other facilities using the private sector efficiency 
improvement achieved via unified management will enable the 
lowering landing fees and aggressive efforts attract airlines 
present landing and other fees for all state run japanese 
airports are uniform and are decided via centralized 
administration the account for improvement public airport 
infrastructure and airport operators are unable independently 
set fees based supply demand conditions landing fees are 
therefore the same all state run airports resulting high 
costs for low cost carriers lccs and other airlines wishing 
provide low cost services the ability reduce landing fees via 
concession system should thus create favorable conditions for 
attracting airlines needing lower than normal landing fees 
operate successfully addition landing fees efficient price 
setting reflecting supply demand should also become possible 
for the likes tenancy fees for airport buildings because 
management professionals from the private sector will decide 
the prices also see good prospects for airport operators 
providing lower cost and better services 
second expect benefits stem from the enabling unified 
airport management via concessions state run airports 
different bodies manage the terminal buildings the car parks 
and the airport apron and conflicts can arise between these 
bodies should become possible improve efficiency via 
unified management the various operations that make 
airport specifically should possible seek drive 
revenues from non airport business and attract new airline 
services reducing landing fees conversely should also 
possible expand airport business revenues prioritizing 
efforts attract new airline services and thereby expanding 
passenger volume concessions should enable such flexible 
management methods looking examples overseas 
following privatization bristol airport the and gold coast 
airport australia have succeeded attracting new airline 
services albeit from lccs passenger and flight volume has 
expanded these airports owing efficiency improvement via 
the unified management runways terminal buildings and car 
parks this has led higher revenues from non airport 
business 
examples japan japan three airports have far been 
specifically targeted for privatization sendai airport kansai 
international airport and osaka itami international airport 
consideration privatization started earliest for sendai airport 
reflecting the strong support from the governor miyagi 
prefecture for privatization means restoring the airport 
and improving its profitability following the great east japan 
earthquake with the mlit also providing assistance 
preparations for privatization have also made steady progress 
the cases kansai international airport and osaka itami 
international airport furthermore the media have reported that 
the hokkaido government considering concession type 
privatization new chitose airport fukuoka city has set 
consultative panel for fukuoka airport and the first stage 
considering privatization has started exchanges opinions 
between the private sector government and residents 
associations 
based prior cases airport privatization think that the 
most likely targets for concession system are airports that are 
large scale have high volume passengers and look likely 
profitable for operating companies furthermore the 
airport privatization process has been proceeding first places 
where local authorities have been receptive what the outlook 
for airport privatization based the earnings data for airports 
released the mlit present many airports look unlikely 
become profitable without fixed government support even 
they were privatized exhibit nevertheless some 
airports display potential for substantial growth demand

investor guide japanese government balance sheet data 
indicators the japanese government assets 
and liabilities are the japanese government 
balance sheet the mof and sna based data 
national accounts japan 
the japanese government owns large financial 
and non financial assets although institutional 
differences play major role 
expect that the government active use 
concession type pfis will lead effective use 
large non financial assets that are difficult sell 
tale two balance sheets 
terms statistics that enable grasp the japanese 
government assets and liabilities from macro perspective 
the two sets statistics that stand out are the japanese 
government balance sheet gbs compiled mof and the 
cabinet office system national accounts sna for japan 
the gbs captures the financial condition the nation which 
roughly corresponds central government whole 
combining the general accounts with special accounts and 
how they relate budget allowances easy identify the 
sna data meanwhile despite lack clarity details can 
used for international comparisons aggregate data the 
statistics are compiled accordance with common standards 
laid down the data are slow released for both but 
the financial assets and liabilities portion the sna data form 
the basis for the flow funds statistics issued the boj and 
are released each quarter 
difficult use the gbs and sna statistics interchangeably 
because the definition and scope japan government 
sector well the methods recording statistics differ 
significantly the mof statistics the nation roughly 
corresponds central government although also includes 
public institutions the sna exhibit shows the 
inter relationship between the categories government 
departments institutions the budgetary legal definitions and 
the government and public sector defined the sna data 
for reference exhibits specify government institutions 
and budgetary accounts treated public private companies 
rather than general government for example since japan 
post bank also categorized public company outside the 
realm general government its privatization does not directly 
reduce the debt balance the general government account 
data are recorded differently various ways the gbs for 
example amounts corresponding reserves fund public 
pensions are recorded public pension deposits the 
liabilities side while the corresponding items are not recorded 
the sna also note that the sna records jgbs and 
short term financing bills issued general government and 
retained internally without making offsetting eliminations 
whereas jgbs held within the government are offset the 
gbs hence not recorded there

foreign currency reserve money trust deposited with the 
gpif and loans the bulk being 
filp loans there are corresponding liabilities for 
all these asset items the liabilities side the balance sheet 
for the funding for purchasing foreign securities comes 
from the issuance foreign exchange securities 
and for the funding for filp loans comes from the filp 
bonds and deposits for public pension 
deposits are the liability corresponding deposits 
for investment 
investments equities another major financial 
asset item this primarily consists shares owned the 
government special corporations exhibit and capital 
invested independent administrative corporations that have 
not been converted into stock corporations for tangible fixed 
assets the bulk non financial assets mof 
explains that certain fixed assets public property such 
waterways and highways are owned for policy purposes and 
while there basically intention monetize these assets 
through their sale considerable amount included also 
points out that the recorded value assets owned public 
property calculated totaling the past land costs and 
project costs and deducting from the acquisition cost 
estimated amount corresponding depreciation the recorded 
value does not represent the amount recoverable cash

recorded the sna assets the social insurance fund 
the social insurance fund includes public pension money other 
than the gpif such the national public service mutual aid 
association funds part relating filp funds included 
the public finance segment and not contained the 
general government account assets and liabilities 
the liability side sna data had general account balance 
gdp gross debt the general 
government account vary modestly according definitions 
but correspond roughly this figure after minor adjustments 
looking the basis imf statistics the relationship 
between general government financial assets difference 
between gross debt and net debt and general government 
gross debt relative gdp find that usually there 
tendency for financial asset balances shrink gross debt 
increases however japan exception this exhibit 
one reason that systemic factors massive foreign currency 
reserves and public pension funds are swelling both the 
asset and liability sides have seen 
net assets the general government account subtracting 
non financial assets well financial assets from liabilities 
the general account are modest minus 
gdp cannot make simple comparisons but there big 
discrepancy between this and the minus 
gdp the gbs one reason for this seems local 
government finances which are included sna basis 
although the sna data not provide estimates local 
governments own substantial non financial assets and 
think likely that there net asset surplus when viewed 
overall appears that the prospect being able sell many 
these assets directly remote but can look for these 
non financial assets used more effectively for example 
via the sale management rights
