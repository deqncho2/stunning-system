insight abenomics more 
likely succeed with mild 
pace tax hikes 
bottom line future consumption tax hikes are 
necessary part fiscal consolidation but the downside 
risks are large hike goes ahead april 
planned shift more gradual pace consumption 
tax hikes would increase the likelihood success for 
abenomics our view 
market view the majority view seems follows 
additional economic measures will limit the adverse 
economic impact consumption tax and any 
changes the tax hike schedule might cause the fiscal 
risk premium spike and such consumption tax 
hikes are very likely follow the existing schedule and 
any change the current schedule would 
negative event for the economy 
our view consumption tax hike poses large 
downside risks for the economy and prices that cannot 
offset additional economic measures and 
shift schedule gradual consumption tax increases 
would not cause the fiscal risk premium rise such 
there are still chances shift more gradual 
schedule consumption tax hikes and change 
policy toward more gradual pace hikes would 
positive event for the economy expect 
hike would result fiscal contraction around 
gdp see risk that real gdp might lowered 
much more than official 
estimates top this would 
likely see fall public investment about

japan where the tax applies broad swathe items without

from the private sector perspective the absence any large 
tax reducing measures means that the upcoming hikes 
represent fiscal drag and thus stand have negative 
impact the economy accounting terms the burden the 
falls consumers but reality the burden not solely 
shouldered consumers households who pay higher prices 
lower real disposable income but fact shared with some 
corporations the form narrower margins who are unable 
raise after tax prices sufficiently 
hikes year not necessarily outside chance 
given abe cautious stance the impact approval 
ratings and statements cabinet advisors prof etsuro 
honda and prof koichi hamada there are still chances 
easing the scheduled pace hikes our view two 
alternative paths present themselves milder year pace 
proposed prof honda and one year postponement 
the hike proposed prof hamada but gaining support from 
hike advocates within the ldp and the approval the mof 
for the postponement option likely difficult political 
compromise therefore see higher possibility debate 
eventually settling the proposal for mild year pace 
hikes over the five years starting from 
hike april poses high risks 
advocate gradual pace hikes while minimizing the 
negative impact the economy necessary part fiscal 
consolidation yet single hike april poses 
substantial downside risks for the economy and prices 
would regard shift milder pace hikes positive 
event for the japanese economy for the following reasons 
first the japanese economy has yet exit deflation and 
self sustained private sector recovery not yet certain 
such hiking the once may adversely impact the 
economy more than the government and boj envision see 
part below and can expect see pullback 
from large scale some economic stimulus 
making inopportune time for tax hikes even additional 
economic stimulus were rolled out the bulk the 
hike negative impact still likely felt view the 
adverse economic impact implementing large tax hike 
around the same time that government spending cut risky 
second rapid pace rate hikes from april not 
consistent with the boj target inflation based the 
cpi excluding within around years see part 
temporary widening the output gap that strengthens 
disinflationary trend could dampen household sector inflation 
expectations 
curbs expenditure addition consumption tax issues are also 
key element the fiscal reform debate for discussion the 
desirable medium long term road fiscal reform see robert 
feldman japan economics insight second arrow well launched 
but far from target published august 
fourth the potential for change the hike schedule 
hurt confidence japanese fiscal policy any major degree 
and drive the jgb risk premium very low see part 
one line objection that corporations will incur high 
implementation costs hikes come annual increments 
but find this less than convincing for the following reasons 
firms that not have change price labels thanks 
zero inflation environment would incur the cost updating 
price labels menu costs under mild inflation anyway 
until now tax exclusive pricing tax has 
been prohibited but the passage bill passing the 
prices june opened the way for tax exclusive 
pricing this greatly reduces the cost changing price 
labels survey data already indicates that 
supermarkets intend adopt tax exclusive pricing 
invoicing systems such those used europe have yet 
introduced japan meaning that corporations will not 
incur invoicing costs due tax rate changes 
since october social insurance premiums which 
closely resemble tax effect have risen per 
annum and are scheduled continue rising until the 
gradual increases have not caused any major turmoil 
the sections that follow address the four reasons why 
advocate adjusting the size the upcoming hikes

the impact the hike 
large scale supplementary budget could 
heighten market concerns that fiscal management 
could lapse into big government tax spend

government boj anticipate negative impact about

actual impact could bigger than the government boj 
expect 
believe that the hike could hurt household and 
corporate sentiment and affect the economy more severely 
than estimated the government and the boj considering 
that japan has yet fully exit deflation and self sustaining 
recovery the private sector not yet certain 
the recent rise prices has been driven chiefly hikes 
electricity charges and gasoline prices that the trend 
fact deflationary that consumers disposable income being 
squeezed the style core data excluding energy and fresh 
food continue down yoy with the output gap also staying 
negative territory wage hikes too remain rather limited 
this point amid this backdrop sentiment related economic 
indicators such the economy watchers survey and the 
consumer confidence survey are also worsening marginally 
indicating that the momentum improvement observed 
initially starting slow for instance household related 
comments the economy watchers survey are generally 
quite negative given that the current economic recovery has 
been driven largely personal consumption relying 
considerably household expectations for abenomics and 
better sentiment backed strength the stock market 
believe the potential impact the hike via worsening 
household sentiment should not underestimated 
also note the risk that hike under deflationary 
environment may directly depress margins corporations that 
struggle fully pass price hikes clients thereby increasing 
risks for businesses large hike without adequate price 
hikes could worsen corporate sentiment mainly that smes 
and weaker sentiment could turn hurt capex which the

another point remember that impact analyses based 
econometric models can deliver significantly different results 
depending the assumptions used fact exhibit shows 
that the cabinet office estimates vary greatly between years 
ordinary quantitative models come with several caveats that 
they cannot fully estimate psychological impact adequately 
gauge non linear effects highlighted professor koichi 
hamada adviser the and the outcome can depend 
lot upon assumptions for the extent which households 
make forward looking decisions this respect possible 
that the negative impact the hike will magnified due 
consumer confidence not rising enough with regard 
future social security reforms and control inefficient

liquidity constrained households may the

ccfsi survey 
prof hamada has said that generally the negative impact the 
economy increase consumption tax proportional the 
square the increase tax rate reuters interview july 
for example given the cut national civil servants salary from 
the government had been requesting comparable cut local 
government salaries however july local governments 
had rejected the request and decided not cut salaries households 
may understanding the decision maintain certain salary level 
the local government has adequate tax revenue and efficient fiscal 
conditions yet whether households fully accept local government fiscal 
discipline remains highly questionable our view when higher 
portion revenue from consumption tax hikes will allocated local 
governments 
assuming that supplementary budget around trillion 
put place could the negative impact the hike offset 
our view that such additional supplementary budget 
would not able fully offset the negative impact because 
the sizable reactionary fall off the large trillion

course this reactionary fall will smaller only 
small ratio the budget actually spent however

more fundamental issue that the government formulating

such concerns might raise the fiscal risk premium the 
perception could that supplementary budgets are becoming

varying degrees exhibit another factor that unlike initial 
budgets where the mof conducts strict assessment the

for the sake comparison new zealand the gst rate 
was raised from october 
and still effective after vrr adjustment 
bigger margin effective increase than japan april 
however worth highlighting that the increase was part 
extensive overhaul the tax system which included tax 
cuts elsewhere october also saw the lowering the 
highest income tax rate from the past the 
maximum rate was and the corporation tax rate from 
the past where japan concerned 
there very little likelihood cuts non consumption tax 
areas income corporate tax and the impact 
consumption tax hike the economy accordingly would 
probably greater than the new zealand experience

adjusted for such vrr differences japan proposed hike 
april after vrr adjustment makes 
rare case internationally exhibit the majority cases 
the effective margin vrr adjusted tax rate increases 
lower for single year since the vrr shows the 
degree tax collection efficiency high good and this 
arguably makes the case for limiting the margin consumption

was far from the only factor behind the post stagnation

fiscal balance likely improve nominal gdp picks 
believe that other things being equal higher nominal gdp 
growth reduces fiscal deficits faster reducing the debt 
nominal gdp ratio more than otherwise due the following 
three elements the high elasticity tax revenue means 
growth creates significant revenue upside the need for 
economic stimulus reduced inefficient spending via 
supplementary budgets that not adhere the initial budget 
discipline suppressed while with nominal interest rates 
unlikely rise far and the average interest payment burden 
increases only modestly 
the relationship between and such that when nominal 
gdp rises the primary balance improves tax revenues build 
rapidly and since average debt servicing costs increase only 
moderately the fiscal deficit likely narrow the
