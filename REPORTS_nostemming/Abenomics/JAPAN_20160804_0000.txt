will japanese unemployment hit 
our baseline forecast foresees stability the unemployment rate 
however there risk unemployment falling less

unemployment rate under growth and 
labor supply scenarios 
forecast labor demand based curve for labor productivity the 
acceleration phase long past productivity growth will likely low our 
forecast gdp growth would require rise employment about 
between 
the labor supply model based demographics for male labor assume 
that participation rates remain fixed across age groups the position for 
female labor posit three scenarios participation rate shifts for all age 
groups pts pts and however aging pushes the 
population into age groups with lower participation there also downward 
pressure labor supply net labor supply depends the balance these 
forces 
our base case presumes upward shift female participation rates 
despite adverse demographics such large shift allows labor supply rise 
about however upward shift only pts would result 
lower labor supply about shift all would lower labor 
supply about mln the corresponding unemployment rates for these 
three scenarios are and hence the risks are skewed toward 
lower unemployment rate 
what watch the key factors that might push unemployment are 
fiscal stimulus that proves more effective than foresee and participation 
increases that fall short our forecast should either materialize there would 
significant implications for wages prices monetary policy and asset prices

introduction 
earlier piece emphasized that fall the japanese unemployment rate 
about would likely bring sharply higher wages and bring prices within spitting 
distance the abe government target the argument summarized exhibit 
drew phillips curve using annual data from augmented the actual 
inflation rate boj core definition proxy for inflation expectations then looked 
the correlation cpi inflation again boj core with hourly wages also using annual 
data combining these two relationships this analysis suggests that the unemployment 
rate moving from the current level seen the vertical dotted lines 
would take the economy wide hourly wage rate increase about turn this 
hourly wage growth would bring inflation about 
the next question obvious will the unemployment rate actually fall 
below when address these questions follows first create scenarios 
for labor demand based gdp growth and labor productivity trends using unique 
approach productivity forecasting then create scenarios for labor supply 
based the standard population projections from the japanese government and 
scenarios for changes labor force participation rates then combine demand and 
supply derive the unemployment rate 
exhibit phillips curve analysis unemployment hourly wage and 
cpi inflation

deriving labor demand deceptively simple the basic 
relationship where denotes labor and 
denotes gdp this merely restatement the simplest 
production function scenarios for gdp are simple 
just assume growth rate scenarios for labor productivity 
are much harder because the growth rate productivity changes 
non linear way over time curve one good way 
model productivity seen exhibit this method captures the 
idea acceleration and deceleration which common across the 
economic history many countries the diagram chose 
parameters for the curve way maximize the fit actual 
data from then used these parameters make 
projections labor productivity 
with these projections labor productivity can derive projections labor 
demand simply using gdp scenarios for example the labor productivity projection 
for mln worker gdp were trl real terms implying 
annual growth from then labor demand would persons 
contrast gdp growth were then labor demand would mln

close look the diagrams shows that have actually biased the scenario labor 
demand upward modestly and thus the scenario for unemployment rate upward 
well why because instead allowing productivity revert trend from the recent 
above trend level extend productivity from the actual level the growth 
rates implied the curve note that the level productivity has exceeded the scurve about over the last decade perhaps because the impact reforms 
starting the koizumi era 
labor supply demographics drive supply

far more important hence order create labor supply scenarios focus

for females the situation more complicated since there 
has been enormous change participation rates longer 
schooling lowered the participation rates for the age group 
but all other groups the group saw increases some 
cases sharp ones for the age group the increase was pts the irony that the overall participation rate females 
actually fell during this period from how could 
this happen with men the population shifted into older wage 
brackets however the impact this population shift aging 
was large that more than offset the impact the upward 
shift the participation profile

for males the participation rates were largely stable for primeage males but fell for both the very young and the very old 
the case the young this change stemmed largely from longer 
schooling for the old stemmed from the move labor from 
farm factory and from rural areas cities along with the 
increase social welfare systems that reduced the burden 
early retirements interestingly the overall participation rate for 
males fell during this period from this large drop 
stemmed from double whammy not only did the participation 
rates for older men fall but their share the population rose 
our scenarios make the optimistic assumption that there will 
more change the participation profile males short 
freeze the male participation profile the level and let 
population structure alone impact the male labor force

putting these calculations for males and females together the 
least optimistic scenario change the participation profiles 
for either males females shows the labor force falling from

profile shifting upward pts per year shows the labor 
force rising mln see exhibit thus even the most 
optimistic labor force scenario the labor force barely rises the

another potential source employment foreign workers but 
this source seems unlikely impact aggregate employment over 
the next few years true there has been some relaxation rules 
for foreign workers special economic zones true there 
growing segment the population that wants easier immigration rules especially labor 
intensive businesses desperate find workers and people taking care the elderly 
young children while still working however for historical reasons immigration 
remains sensitive topic japan moreover around the world focus more the 
costs rather than the benefits hence not think that foreign workers will provide 
meaningful increment the labor force over the next few years 
regression the log the female labor force lagged log gdp for the 
previous two years with correction yields cumulative coefficients the two 
log gdp terms both terms have values excess the coefficient 
and the adjusted squared similar regression for males yields 
cumulative coefficients log gdp terms only with both still having values 
above for the male regression however the coefficient thus while gdp 
does impact participation rates with statistical significance the absolute impact low 
the large coefficients imply that momentum more important than gdp

what are the key factors watch 
think that the scenarios above show significant risk that the unemployment rate 
could fall below this would crucial development light the 
spittin distance analysis above order stay top this crucial issue 
necessary focus two factors 
what will happen gdp growth and labor supply unemployment would fall 
sharply two cases first growth could higher than our forecast which possible 
light fiscal policy stimulus now being undertaken second labor participation rates 
may not rise quickly our base case foresees contrast stimulus policy fails 
bring growth the labor participation rates continue their rapid rise then the 
unemployment rate would not fall 
more hidden issue the pace productivity growth first what abenomics 
growth policies are more successful than most now foresee and productivity 
accelerates this case productivity might accelerate and hold labor demand down 
and thus prevent the unemployment rate from falling second emerging wage 
pressures labor markets could spur labor saving investment indeed economy wide 
hourly wages have been rising between for about year wage increases are 
particularly high some labor intensive sectors and sectors where skill shortages are 
severe innovations labor use are particularly likely these areas and may spur 
faster productivity growth 
short while stick our base case the unemployment rate remaining near 
current levels also recognize significant risks particularly labor supply the risks 
are likely skewed toward slowdown participation rate increases and thus toward 
unemployment rate that might reach light the implications faster 
drop unemployment wages prices and bond yields would prudent for 
investors pay special attention both growth rates and labor force participation 
rates
