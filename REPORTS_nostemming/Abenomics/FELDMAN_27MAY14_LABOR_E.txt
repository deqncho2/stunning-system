dualism labor markets shrinking slowly the 
two major types dualism are firm size and 
gender large firms have seen wages down with 
employment flat while small firms have seen wages flat 
with employment down gender dualism has contracted 
but remains large 
the policy response labor shortage has been 
inadequate measured against the speed and size 
aging and skill shortages abenomics has begun 
address some labor market issues such increased

recoveries exhibit the offers surge has come from 
part time offers such offers are genuine but they show less 
confidence economic prospects than full time job offers

exhibit shows the interaction quantity and price the 
gender dualistic labor market since both real wages per 
hour and employment for males have fallen cumulatively 
and respectively for females the same period 
employment has risen and real wages per hour 
that said even after these differentials female 
employment about male employment and the female 
real wages per hour are about the male level

differentially the basis size firm legal status duration

draw implications for companies and for the economy 
simplistic model the labor market would posit demand 
curve and supply curve with wages and employment

one type employee and everyone would paid the 
same wage course such abstraction while helpful 
heuristic wholly inadequate for the real world because 
would not able explain the dual nature the market

size duality the labor market 
data from the mof corporate statistics the only source 
where consistent figures exist for wages employment capital 
stock etc across broad range industries and sizes firms 
outline the size the distinctions the mof data large 
firms bln capital more employ about mln people 
average compensation per worker mln per year 
contrast non large firms capital employ 
mln people average compensation mln per year 
the questions are why employment concentrated small 
firms with low wages even while large firms with high wages 
exist and why there low arbitrage between the two 
markets 
there are several reasons that the demand curve for labor 
could differ size firm the most important capital 
intensity the amount capital used per worker large firms 
significantly higher for most industries seen exhibits 
and indeed there are only five sectors which the capital 
intensity non large firms exceeds that the large firms 
three these five are service industries where economies 
scale production are minimal the other two medical welfare 
services and agriculture are heavily regulated ways that 
have obstructed economies scale usually the behest 
vested interests 
there clear tendency for large firms pay higher wages 
and this likely related capital intensity the more capital 
intense the firm the more capital each worker has making 
higher wages possible another crucial reason for differing 
demand curves appears economies scale when firms 
realize economies scale they become more efficient 
allowing both larger size and higher wages

the simple answer because the demand curves are 
different and the supply curves are different the hard part 
explaining why these curves differ size firm 
what about the supply curves why they differ the answer 
appears worker characteristics such education 
location age gender and family characteristics very broad 
brush the supply curve labor for large firms tends more 
educated more location mobile willing move and more 
male favoring pay and promotion the supply curve for 
smaller firms tends less educated less location mobile 
and less male favoring pay and promotion 
mof corporate statistics data have their problems most importantly 
that they are based parent only data they also fail cover the 
financial industry for this reason the figures the text must

gender duality the labor market 
dual labor market forecasting framework 
similar approach can taken for modeling gender duality 
exhibit there are two labor markets based gender 
the male labor market both demand and supply are high but 
inelastic the demand and supply curves are both quite 
steep the female labor market both demand and supply 
are lower and highly elastic the demand and supply curves 
are both quite flat 
this framework important because allows answer the 
next question what likely happen employment and 
wages this question essentially comes down forecasting 
how the demand and supply curves will shift light key 
factors identify four key factors supply globalization 
demand globalization demographics and mismatch exhibit 
gives overview with potential offsets 
exhibit 
supply globalization affects both large and small firm demand 
curves large firms can easily move production facilities 
abroad source inputs from foreign suppliers when they 
their supplier relationships with small firms are impacted 
hence the small firms also feel the impact supply 
globalization either directly indirectly demand globalization 
impacts both large and small firms well large firms which 
typically have broader information networks identify demand 
trends abroad will typically quicker capitalize demand 
globalization even small firms however can benefit 
immensely from demand globalization when knowledge 
their products spreads abroad when they supply key inputs 
globalized large firms 
dual labor market based gender 
source mof corporate statistics and morgan stanley research calculations 
why the male and female demand and supply curves 
differ the chief factor the supply side likely stems from 
sociology about male and female roles society historically 
males have been considered the primary workers and social 
assumptions push them supply more labor regardless 
circumstances contrast females have been considered 
back workers and are more flexible vis vis changes 
economic conditions 
the demand side harder explain much the explanation 
here may also stem from social role assumptions but there 
may also economic aspect because social roles 
specifically the expectation that females are more responsible 
for household maintenance and child care firms have the 
expectation that females are less likely remain firm 
continuously able transfer far away business 
locations thus with shorter expected employment horizons 
the firms may less willing invest training and promotion 
for females unfortunately such expectations turn into 
self fulfilling prophesy and result discrimination what may 
economically rational for single firm becomes 
economically irrational for society whole 
for the supply curves demographics impact both large and 
small firms but have larger impact the small because 
small firms are more labor intensive however large firms are 
more heavily exposed some demographic factors 
educational levels for example educational levels 
location mobility japan deteriorate then the supply curve 
labor for large firms will shift inward faster than that for small 
firms particular area for concern mismatch industries

source morgan stanley research 
source mof corporate statistics and morgan stanley calculations 
the case gender based duality the major shifts the 
demand and supply curves come from changing attitudes 
social roles and changing expectations firms women 
education has improved significantly and attitudes toward 
working women have changed among both men and women 
the demand side firms have developed methods along 
with legal requirements keep women work longer thus 
justifying more investment training the result virtuous 
circle increasing opportunity increasing skill levels and 
converging wages 
the facts what has actually happened wages 
and employment 
exhibit gives the facts recent developments wages 
and employment the results for large and non large firms are 
quite different large firms have seen modest employment 
loss and large wage drops non large firms have seen huge 
employment loss and modest wage gains 
what has happened gender based view the labor 
market attitudes have changed have demand and 
supply curves exhibit the male labor market both real 
hourly wage and employment have fallen seen above the 
real hourly wage down about cumulatively since 
and employment another contrast female 
real hourly wages are about and employment 
about 
these results are all the more remarkable light the fact 
that both males and females are aging which reduces labor 
supply the share older population with low labor force 
participation rates rises the key understanding why lies 
the age profile participation rates exhibit for males the 
age profile participation rates modestly lower since 
with the exception the population groups contrast 
female participation rates are significantly higher virtually 
every age group thus while aging among females exerts 
downward pressure female participation the change the 
age profile far has offset aging and helped push the female 
labor force higher balance the female participation rate 
has been largely flat since the exhibit

comments range from near panic about labor shortages 
some labor intensive sectors with high demand 
construction parts transportation and restaurants 
resigned ennui capital intensive sectors facing strong foreign 
competition interestingly the majority analysts are more 
the ennui camp this fact attributable their coverage 
mostly large firms which are capital intensive and general 
more exposed global competitive pressures the implication 
that for the stock market which comprises largely highly 
capital intensive firms the direct impact the labor shortage 
far less than for the economy whole 
does this mean that listed firms general need not worry 
about the labor shortage certainly not first even for those 
with large foreign demand the domestic market far from 
insignificant any factor that bottleneck domestic 
demand will boomerang onto the top line all japanese firms 
addition the labor shortage may pose threat longer term 
japanese industrial competitiveness the extent that 
sustainable business requires continued investment and the 
extent that large part investment labor intensive nature

automakers ryosuke hoshino 
overall most firms the auto industry are raising base pay and bonus however individual basis the earnings impact 
each firm limited increases labor costs would not cause earnings worsen the near term for example 
estimate toyota individual labor cost rise yoy but this small proportion operating profit rather the 
upward pressure wages emerging markets primarily asia structural concern 
oems have domestic output capacity over units relative the domestic basic demand are not seeing 
labor shortages around half domestic output exported overseas and look for overseas sales expand further 
mainly developing countries expect exports from japan cover some this increase but given non tariff barriers 
local production will likely the main source thus domestic labor shortage unlikely issue addition risks 
stronger yen would drive the shift overseas production 
from the standpoint productivity most the automobile production process automated making additional improvement 
productivity difficult but firms may able improve productivity reviewing designs promote 
modularization standardized parts through top bottom product planning thus not see domestic labor demand 
rising addition the shift overseas production bases would limit the risk firms facing labor shortages that said 
non production related fields such and software engineering are experiencing some labor shortage 
auto parts shinji kakiuchi 
for the auto parts industry just under half vehicles produced domestically are destined for export markets the long 
run expect offshoring continue though there sense staffing surplus present think the numbers employed 
domestically will continue decline current domestic wage increases are mainly taking the shape returning good 
earnings the back weak yen and earnings overseas the workforce bonuses firms are more circumspect about 
raising base salaries domestically the main roles are those such functions enhance future technologies fuel 
consumption safety security etc and production tech support for output start ups ems and elsewhere overseas while 
expect demand for ordinary factory workers decrease think shortage highly specialized engineers will remain 
problematic for auto parts company management increased royalties and dividends etc from overseas subsidiaries may 
option consider responding the strengthening role japan mother factory role also anticipate 
contraction the domestic workforce tier and suppliers who have been slower move overseas according meti 
industrial statistics are employed auto parts manufacture with working firms with fewer than 
people the payroll firms with payrolls and those with more employees 
there marked difference per capita salaries these respective entities ranging from about and 
though some the profit improvement tier suppliers automakers due the weaker yen should trickle down 
tier suppliers easing downward pressure parts sourcing prices domestically may see shrinking equilibrium 
chemicals takato watabe 
the chemicals industry some areas may experience labor shortages but not think they are significant part the 
overall picture surplus capacity petrochemicals and basic chemicals particular means there problem with 
manpower looking the japanese chemicals industry the past years the payroll years ago was about 
was just over lower though the slide abating are not seeing any turnaround growth the 
basis total cash salaries compensation down about versus years ago per capita wages 
have contracted from just over just over the petrochemicals industry japan took off the and the 
past years have brought the retirement many experienced workers taken the and this may explain 
the drop average salaries japan now home ethylene crackers but suspensions three these between 
and have been announced non ethylene fields well expect plant suspensions decommissioning etc for basic 
chemicals such synthetic fiber raw materials this essentially plant industry and does not require large numbers 
workers expect domestic payrolls continue shrinking the same time with other industries overseas production 
exposure rising companies are raising productivity producing less japan and more overseas for increases 
base salaries expect little this other industries

construction atsushi takagi 
the labor shortage here similar the bubble era with the gap between new job openings applicants 
end the difficulty securing construction workers for public works projects prompting the government 
enter public works contracts where labor unit costs are increased about public projects costs rise sharply after 
contracts have been signed contract terms are changed retrospectively meaning stable profit margins for the construction 
industry private sector projects contrast not the practice change prices between contract signing and 
completion margins are being squeezed costs rise the intervening period result private construction project 
unit costs are now rising too and some placers private sector orders are starting consider curbing capex due 
progressive construction inflation with construction demand set remain brisk expect construction inflation 
persist our main interest being whether the further advance construction inflation leads cuts private sector capex 
consumer electronics masahiro ono 
wages are mainly large companies but the labor market not tight cuts salaries amid restructuring large 
companies are set reversed one notable example panasonic where personnel costs are much 
but still manageable thanks restructuring effects savings the last year pioneer has cut pay for two 
years but will raise base salaries even consumer electronics firms not have the option passing higher 
salaries product prices entry barriers are low globally and consumers are less fussy about quality than before not 
anticipate product price hikes 
the industry over rather than under supplied labor most firms are relocating functions overseas the only area any 
which short personnel technicians for example prodded demand slump the past few years sony

option started pulling out pcs moreover even not viable option becomes easier for management decide 
restructuring the message sony steps pull through are one the key points for 
consumer staples discretionary taizo demura 
foods there very little evidence base pay raises the primary areas uncertainty are effects the tax hike and 
overall growth costs since sales volume has increased under abenomics firms are covering compensation increases not 
with higher base pay but with bonuses with demand not expected rise the future there inclination increase 
recruitment even firms who handle their own logistics bread meat etc and employ relatively large workforces there 
sense labor shortage there are signs wages being hiked including for non regular workers most could said 
that firms involved convenience store operation have increased wages for casual workers owing minor personnel 
shortages but the overall picture not one wage cost inflation 
logistics costs have risen where these activities are outsourced for example due shortages truck drivers higher 
gasoline prices only logistics that costs are rising the demand side domestic demand flat where there demand 
growth this growth fully covered convenience stores the elderly and female shopper markets not envisage 
labor demand changing dramatically for the time being 
electronic components shoji sato 
estimate overseas production ratios for electronic components companies and averaging about

now run mother plants for perfecting production technologies and capex japan confined spending manufacturing 
equipment where wage growth concerned growth base salaries japan limited and though higher performance linked 
bonuses push domestic labor costs expect rising wages asia where production has been relocated have greater 
impact corporate earnings than wage growth domestically japan however for all the leading electronic components firms 
falling product prices take more severe toll earnings than rising wages prime reason being the need cut prices

most our discussions with leading firms have drawn the response that personnel levels are about right meti industrial 
statistics too show sales per head the workforce still about below the peak even there are signs supply demand

streamlining and overseas start ups for some time both response offshoring production facilities users industries 
such electronics and autos and order expand non japanese customer bases and seems fair say that this trend 
gathering further momentum similar trends can seen the nonferrous and cable spaces specific examples among large 
companies including nssm kobe steel nisshin steel and uacj from the angle employment and given that this 
plant intensive space there does not appear any major imbalance present and even the scale surplus personnel 
likely created plant streamlining does not appear excessive though partly due shifting personnel overseas for 
labor costs well performance linked awards expect some firms raise base salaries however labor 
accounts for only total costs the earnings impact should limited that said discussion the effects 
manpower shortages cannot ignore the creeping impact that labor shortages user industries such construction 
reinforcing bar placers jobs applicants ratio have demand for steel products per 
machinery yoshinao ibara and jin sup park 
machinery nearly all firms cover have raised base salaries and many also pay performance linked bonuses hence 
anticipate growth fixed costs due rising personnel expenses between now and with negative implications for 
operating profit too even not expect growth personnel costs account for high proportion overall operating 
profit with the demand climate continuing brighten well and firms making efforts raise productivity and lower costs with 
view improving earnings think they will comfortably able absorb the rise personnel costs efforts improve 
productivity include production off shoring and integrating parts platforms which think can curb growth non personnel 
costs the mid term too few firms the machinery industry are the view that wage growth will seriously impact earnings 
rather personnel costs rise ems such china where they have been relatively cheap the past firms are gradually 
proceeding with automating manufacturing processes and other measures aimed lightening the burden overseas 
personnel cost growth among firms our coverage see many that are moving confine domestic activities production

for japan permit full immigration this has invited rejoinders such that immigrants will take job opportunities from 
japanese people the crime rate will rise however the majority young japanese people are unwilling work 
construction sites and aging the trained experienced workforce ultimately creating labor shortage may well worth 
considering opening the labor market overseas workers fill the gap would also question whether there objective 
data back the argument that the crime rate rises because immigration increases other recent proposals include 
extending the permitted stay overseas trainees the job training schemes make for labor shortages arising 
between now and the tokyo olympics via temporary legislation permitting entry past trainees but hard shake

immigration and foreign labor 
troubling aspect labor market policy has been the debate 
use foreign labor japan has one the lowest levels 
use foreign labor among industrial countries although the 
pace increase has been substantial recent years the 
levels remain low there has been increased discussion 
immigration and foreign labor late particularly light 
severe shortages labor intensive service sectors however 
the policy the government remains extremely cautious 
for example long meeting the council economic and 
fiscal policy cefp april the issue foreign labor 
was discussed detail the comments cabinet ministers 
range from hesitant hostile see exhibit light such 
comments understandable that potential foreign workers 
would not feel welcome 
but there are several deeper problems first the ministers 
statements imply severe limits the conditions under which 
foreign workers would allowed enter the nation both 
the types industries where work would permitted and the 
numbers second such restrictions would prevent creativity 
and adaptability the very sources the innovation that 
needed raise productivity third the approach foreign 
labor threat the olympics because foreign 
construction workers particular may not available time 
fourth the limitation foreign workers does little address 
the longer term problem demographics finally abe 
concluding remarks specifically exclude the notion 
immigration allowing foreigners come japan 
permanently part the growth strategy labor supply 
the message potential foreign workers and companies 
foreign and domestic that japan not land 
opportunity 
exhibit 
comments foreign worker use japan 
tokuhisa tamura minister health labor and welfare 
when considering the scope for accepting foreign workers must first prevent their entry from harming the upward trend wages under 
abenomics also industries with labor shortage extremely important that prevent such industries from not hiring japanese and that 
foreign workers not displace japanese entirely 
the use foreign workers child care and household services first need consideration needs concrete basis support for child 
care from the viewpoint wholesome nurturing future generations and because these are the years personality formation wish ask for 
careful consideration because the problems allowing involvement foreigners who have insufficient understanding japanese language and 
culture 
sadakazu tanigaki minister justice 
some have said that support for families needed but must consider the impact other labor markets and public safety may invite the 
misperception that are accepting cheap labor 
keiji furuya chairman the public safety commission 
there are concerns about expanding entry foreigners due illegal labor illegal visa overstay increase foreigner crimes and public safety 
must consider this carefully the shortage construction labor must first consider bringing experienced workers back into the labor 
force the extent possible should deal with the issue using domestic personnel this proves insufficient and expand entry 
foreigners need restrict the numbers needs and have strict control firms and public authorities that illegal entry visa overstay 
foreigner crime and public safety problems are avoided need mechanisms prevent public safety problems 
yoshitaka shindo 
speaking minister for national economic zones part the problem the housing and living environment services for foreign companies that 
enter japan think that need try new things such household services and nursing care within the special zones need concrete plans 
want tackle this issue and think important the basis opinions expressed today experiment the zones and prove the concepts 
concluding remarks shinzo abe 
please advance consideration mechanisms increase use foreign workers giving due consideration avoiding the mistaken view that this 
immigration policy and focusing promotion activity women and medium and long term economy growth all with sufficient control

these comments from the ministers make the conclusion 
abundantly clear there will very little meaningful 
expansion foreign labor use japan least for few years 
particularly the less skilled end the labor market this 
conclusion has several implications firms 
labor intensive industries will continue face significant 
upward pressure wages the necessity for raising 
productivity all firms becomes even greater short since 
progress labor policies slow progress other growth 
strategy areas becomes even more urgent 
legal reform hesitant 
the abe government has passed some changes labor law 
which will make labor markets somewhat more flexible there 
have been extensions the maximum period for fixed term 
employment for certain categories professional labor for 
example the special economic zones guidelines have 
been proposed for clarifying the conditions that apply under 
japanese labor law which remains unchanged however the 
impact these changes remains unclear especially since the 
local committees for implementing each special zone have yet 
formed 
these steps while welcome only scratch the surface 
clarifying labor law exhibit the key problem the 
contradiction between the freedom firms dismiss 
employees with days notice labor standards act article 
and the vague case case conditions that individual 
judges have used determine dismissals have been legal 
labor contracts law article addition the laws give 
most protection regular staff principle indeed large part 
the shift non regular workers may stem from the business 
risks that these legal uncertainty creates while regular 
workers may have benefited from the legal ambiguity 
non regular staff are left bear the brunt pressures the 
economy and face adverse incentives acquire skills with 
this complex set rules still force the ideal equal pay for 
equal work which crucial not only for justice but also for 
economic efficiency and human capital development will 
remain elusive

key points japanese labor law 
for indefinite term labor contracts principle firms have the right dismiss employees with days notice 
labor standards act section civil law section 
however under case law when the used the employer right dismiss exercised grounds inconsistent with objection and rational reasons 
when not acceptable under social standards the court may void the action abuse such right doctrine dismissal abuse article the 
labor contract law which puts case law doctrine statutory form says dismissal shall invalid when lacks objectively rational reasons when 
cannot judged consistent with social standards 
note for fixed term labor contracts article the labor contracts law prohibits termination labor contract prior the expiration the term 
with necessary justification 
the labor standards act requires the reasons for termination set each firm rules employment and demonstrating the applicability 
objective and rational reasons for dismissal thus becomes the central point contention applying these rules employment even cases where 
the applicability the rules recognized courts may consider whether dismissal justified 
labor standards act section 
items that constitute objective and rational reasons are classified follows 
dismissal for inability the worker perform the work needed 
dismissal for lack ability lack performance poor work attitude lack appropriate qualifications 
dismissal for violation work discipline for negligence 
dismissal due business reasons 
dismissal agreement union shop 
even for dismissals conducted for business reasons labor contract law article states that the doctrine dismissal abuse applies 
under the japanese system long term employment when dismissal occurs for economic reasons measures have been taken such 
consultation management and labor reduction ending overtime reducing ending new hiring intra firm transfers ending employment 
non regular staff temporary furlough and seeking voluntary retirement the most frequent agreed contract termination through early retirement etc 
result case law the validity economic based dismissals focuses the following four items and renders decisions concrete 
comprehensive consideration 
necessity staff cuts 
whether efforts avoid staff cuts have been exhausted 
justifiability the criteria for selecting those dismissed 
validity procedures for dismissal 
the case foreign companies 
when 
labor has been hired mid career from external labor markets under strict headcount control focused department special skill needs and 
high levels compensation are paid based the job performance 
then 
dismissal occurs the result elimination department and 
reassignment different department not possible 
dismissal can valid large additional severance payment made and aid reemployment provided

clock speed abenomics labor policy 
this context important recall that investor clocks tick 
faster than policy clocks investors are constantly demanding 
quick action while policymakers both bureaucrats and 
politicians are constantly pleading for more time society does 
not change quickly markets particularly when law 
political institutions and government administration are heavily 
influenced those who oppose change 
would only make the economy weaker were not exit 
with inflation accelerating and little growth then there might 
disruptions the bond market 
thus the intent the accord between the boj and the 
government from jan one step closer 
realization the accord stated 
order for japan economy overcome deflation 
early possible and return sustainable growth path 
with price stability efforts wide range entities 
strengthen growth potential are crucial the bank will 
continue thoroughly examine the progress toward 
strengthening growth potential and the ensuing 
developments the expected inflation rate households 
and firms the meantime the government has shown its 
intention aggressively pursue steps for strengthening 
competitiveness and growth potential japan economy 
and steadily promote measures aimed establishing 
sustainable fiscal structure 
thus there interplay between markets and policies labor 
other policies the cric cycle model crisis 
response improvement and complacency that describes this 
interaction alive and well labor markets well see 
japan economics cric cycle reprint the moment 
labor policy japan remains state complacency 
however wage pressures grow and skill shortages 
create economic bottlenecks truck drivers construction 
workers pilots waiters system engineers etc then 
pressure for action likely grow especially weak stock 
market reflects the adverse impact bottlenecks 
events recent days give some evidence that pressure for 
more extensive reforms some areas building friday 
may the ldp published its new growth strategy citing 
weak stock prices trigger the ldp document focused 
squarely productivity growth the first measure proposed 
was cutting the corporate tax rate while expanding the tax 
base the document then concentrated corporate 
governance and recommended several unexpected measures 
such unwinding bank cross shareholdings 
addition the document proposed gingerly spending control 
social security unfortunately however the plan hesitant 
labor policy the word immigration did not appear the 
document this suggests that major reforms requiring legal 
changes labor law will come later rather than sooner 
that said pressure the diet coming from unexpected 
source boj governor haruhiko kuroda gave interview 
the nikkei shimbun may and called for more rapid 
progress structural reform with the trigger being the labor 
shortage gov kuroda concerned that building labor market 
pressures could threaten price stability without more 
aggressive structural reform should labor market tightness 
generate higher wages and prices while growth remains low 
then the boj would face dilemma with good alternatives 
were exit its current monetary stance because inflation 
but with little prospect economic recovery then higher yields 
see cobwebs and crics robert feldman morgan stanley april 
reprinted december japan economics cric 
cycle reprint 
should prices not move the boj expects and remain 
more cautious the price and growth outlook than the boj 
then more action from monetary policy remains possible even 
gov kuroda has referred repeatedly this possibility 
however the labor shortage has made implementation the 
accord all the more important and urgent the stock market 
has been saying for some time that the ball the 
government court now the boj saying too 
thus the key factor watch how pro reform policymakers 
use market impatience and boj statements market 
movements can powerful force for convincing anti reform 
forces that change needed can the boj abe utilizes 
market pressure and boj statements amplify pressure 
reform then more efficient more sustainable japanese 
economy and more market friendly outcome become 
likely
