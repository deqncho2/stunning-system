the major defeat the ldp the tokyo assembly election has raised concerns about 
the future abenomics order analyze prospects use the cric cycle which 
comprises four phases crisis response improvement and complacency the key 
element cric cycle the response phase when response enhances economic 
fundamentals the economy achieves longer term growth not any recovery shortlived 
for the abe government long period complacency has been followed the 
crisis the tokyo assembly election result indeed tokyo assembly elections have 
been harbingers for national trends recent decades and thus the ldp naturally 
worried about what may happen the next general election which must held 
end however there contradiction effective response would require 
ambitious reform the very areas where vested interest support for the ldp 
strongest abe faces difficult choices 
investors face choice well without evidence return forceful reform policies 
more difficult justify investments japan what should investors look for

the seven signals 
labor reform 
the labor reforms from the work style reform committee wsrc were originally 
conceived way enhance productivity however the final result was exactly the 
opposite the proposals tightened labor market regulation and increased burdens 
firms but failed even mention offset for shorter hours through higher hourly pay 
hence signpost for positive response phase the recommendations the work 
style reform report need replaced with win win deregulation strategy 
there are two key elements for successful labor reform sensible white collar 
exemptions from overtime rules and transparent legal rules monetary 
compensation for dismissal the proposals the wsrc report would impose one 
size fits all working hour restrictions all firms and would burden firms with onerous 
reporting requirements and uncertainties about enforcement moreover the lack 
progress white collar exemptions would deter globally active firms such those 
the high end services from locating japan the lack clarity fair monetary 
compensation for dismissal has been key barrier firms seeking raise employment 
uncertain world when downsizing hard firms refrain from upsizing oddly this 
issue was not even mentioned the report the wsrc despite broad public debate 
the matter 
one the most promising ideas the third way contract like current life time 
employment schemes the third way contract would retain open ended duration 
however both the employee and employer would able terminate the contract 
and most importantly there predetermined monetary payment the employee 
the employer terminates the contract usual the employer pays unemployment 
insurance premiums well health and training benefits such system could 
introduced under the special economic zone tokku system order demonstrate 
the benefits would particularly effective for the financial sector where high labor 
mobility essential competitiveness 
the economics labor deregulation are simple the appendix shows why removing 
onerous labor regulations would raise wages for both regular and non regular workers 
and will shift the composition employment toward the higher paid regular worker 
sector 
see japan economics will labor reform succeed mar cit 
explain why deregulation labor rules win win for both regular and non regular 
workers the appendix 
the new rules could bloat overhead and require ongoing software development 
administrative procedures would also involved the new rules would enlarge 
government well invite side deals among bureaucrats and individual firms and tempt 
politicians intervene none these impacts would raise efficiency fairness 
transparency 
tokyo fights regain its erstwhile status global financial center the new 
overtime hour rules would serious barrier one can argue that overtime rules may 
suitable for blue collar and for white collar employees with little control over their 
working arrangements workers who not business across different time zones 
however such jobs are becoming more scarce outmoded assumptions labor laws will 
harm japanese competitiveness this particularly true the financial industry but also 
applies many high tech industries and information intensive industries 
under current law japanese firms are permitted but not required have mandatory 
retirement age for lifetime employees however for firms that use mandatory 
retirement age there are some conditions first the mandatory retirement age must not 
under moreover the mandatory retirement age under the firm 
obligated offer continued employment the retiring employee until age 
although compensation may adjusted 
cabinet reshuffle 
more tenacious policy will require cabinet with more expertise economics especially 
posts that cover economic policy determined action will require ministers who will 
take the lead over bureaucrats setting the economic reform agenda the key posts 
include first and foremost the minister economics who heads the council 
economic and fiscal policy which the key body for setting economic and fiscal policy 
also crucial have economics specialists ministers the ministry finance the 
ministry economics trade and industry meti the ministry health labor and 
welfare where economics has long taken back seat interest groups and vested 
interests the ministry agriculture ditto the ministry education ditto the 
ministry land infrastructure and transport ditto and the ministry justice 
because japan has traditionally ignored economics designing the legal system 
regulatory reform and privatization 
one the most important keys economic revival regulatory reform particularly 
sectors that are heavily influenced government rules medical welfare education 
child care nursing care energy agriculture transportation legal services etc the 
common thread these industries that they are mostly labor intensive except 
energy and transportation and have positive external effects the rest the 
economy for example medical care very patient specific and thus prior the advent 
labor intensive addition has positive externalities healthy population 
improves both the ability current workers work and reduces the need for other 
health care workers these circumstances there ample justification economic 
theory for government intervention according the well developed theory market 
failure 
however the government interventions often wrong such problems occur because 
design government intervention has paid far too little attention government 
failure the reasons that interventions fail our view there are four reasons for 
government failure rent seeking distorted rule making silo decisions and 
bundled services the success and failures abenomics provide hints what policies 
need the most work 
abenomics has scored major successes two areas early agriculture and corporate 
governance see exhibit some areas there has been unexpected progress such 
immigration and education the latter the form eased rules academic 
interaction with private companies tourism has been major success the abe 
government broke bottleneck tourist visa issuance even the medical area there 
has been quiet progress toward evidence based treatment rules there has been 
almost total switch electronic processing medical payments much much more

despite these successes there have been two major disappointments one was failure 
make any major changes the electoral incentives for diet members true two laws 
diet reform one for the house representatives and one for the house 
councilors have been passed however the changes had only limited impact 
reducing voter disparity and only barely complied with the supreme court rulings 
the matter result the incentives for politicians remain heavily skewed toward 
interest group politics particular the heavy over representation non urban areas 
skews policies against further reforms that would challenge regional vested interests 
moreover the skew also makes medical and social security reforms harder because 
non urban prefectures are already far more aged that urban ones note that effective 
diet reform has happened japan the electoral reform passed november 
significantly reduced the overrepresentation non urban areas the house 
representatives and paved the way for the reforms the obuchi mori and koizumi 
cabinets 
the other major disappointment has been labor market reforms despite abe 
intentions when formed the work style reform committee the initiative was mostly 
derailed for several reasons first with the change administration the united 
states geopolitical factors took far more the prime minister time than expected 
second the structure the reform committee was inauspicious even from the date 
formation the committee had nine ministers and others members there were too 
many agendas and the inevitable result was plethora inconsistent proposals third 
the deliberation period went from end september end march enough time for 
vested interests organize resistance finally crucial decisions working hours were 
delegated the representatives big business and big labor groups that have little 
interest labor reform 
light this history believe that investors are looking for action areas where 
policy has achieved either few results and done slow track highlight 
the following five areas reform particularly important for convincing investors that 
japan can achieve sustainable growth 
labor reform the proposals from the work style reform committee need 
replaced with new proposals from new committee see below for characteristics 
needed from new committee the new proposals should include effective white collar 
exemption rules and transparent fair rules monetary compensation for dismissal 
promotion the third way contract would step forward 
medical reform clear numerical target needed what percent gdp may 
spent the government medical care this would also require full adoption 
evidence based reimbursement system for treatments addition full permission 
needed for use non covered treatments patient cost along with covered 
treatments the national medical system lack such joint use called kongo chiryo 
japanese key factors that has stymied competition with the result higher costs 
poorer service and slower technology progress than necessary two other measures 
would active use foreign workers where possible and mandatory skill 
updates condition for renewal medical licenses 
energy reform the changes the energy regulatory system have been laudable 
moreover japan verbal dedication reduction also laudable however the 
national budget for energy research miniscule about trl the equivalent 
social spending moreover the policy approach the energy sector has been 
quite slow recognizing the rapid changes energy technology this slowness stems 
part from the large representation government deliberative bodies legacy energy 
providers who have much lose from the rapid spread new technology 
education universities remain heavily controlled the ministry education and 
are constrained from responding needs students and the labor force this 
equally true private sector universities who typically receive very large share 
their budgets from the ministry which turn has used this power the purse 
impose guidelines some recent moves are being made make universities more selfreliant through creation endowments and more active fund raising but these efforts 
need accelerated sharply lower levels particular attention needed for many 
families under the poverty line unfortunately growing share students much 
more bolder approach learning would secure japan both competitive advantage 
educational software and sharp increase efficiency 
immigration there are now about mln foreign workers japan without them 
the unemployment rate would about not given japanese demographics 
the consequent upward pressure wages and the attractiveness japan 
peaceful stable country increased immigration inevitable however the legal 
framework immigrants remains unstable and protections for foreign workers are 
inadequate which only entices exploitation japan needs immigration strategy based 
macroeconomic trends with clear numerical guidelines how many immigrants with 
what skills will allowed how address inevitable social issues and how prevent 
illegal employment and exploitation 
better decision rules 
key reason for many the failures regulatory reform has been problems with the 
institutions rule making who makes the rules and who makes the rules about 
making the rules policy commissions are typically very large leaving little time for 
individual members impact the debate moreover such policy commissions are 
typically very heavy with insiders who have little incentive reconsider current rules 
important recall the successes the past two deserve highlighting the 
financial emergency project team had only five members and created the 
blueprint for revitalizing the financial system within one month starting deliberations 
the official body for such matters the financial system commission had members 
boj general secretary but for years had not been able make practical 
suggestions the official committees overseeing the electric power sector were 
thoroughly revamped the electricity and gas market surveillance commission which 
was created the wake the nuclear meltdowns comprises only five 
commissioners all have high degrees expertise knowledge economics and 
independence from the industry 
restructuring the deliberative bodies along these lines essential make government 
more responsive economic trends the issue has come before indeed april 
the cabinet set upper limit members for commissions but this order has 
been followed the letter but not the spirit for example the labor policy commission 
currently has members this could reduced about with more diversity 
members far higher density experts economics and better ability make 
decisions the government tax commission which currently has members 
regular members and adjuncts could also reduced about and become far 
more effective the same action could taken for most the other commissions 
see japan economics japan land opportunity feb 
indeed abe himself has complained about the lpc the meeting february 
said the matter limits overtime has been discussed for many years the 
labor policy commission without conclusion 
see japan economics will labor reform succeed mar cit and japan 
economics report card work style reform apr cit 
typical example the labor policy commission lpc japanese rodo seisaku 
shingikai this commission contains members far too many for effective 
committee addition the composition sorely lacking diversity the ten worker 
representatives are all labor union representatives even though unions actually 
represent less than the labor force also the employer representatives 
come from big business firms that are members the japan business federation 
keidanren moreover eight the public representatives are academics from the 
tokyo area thus the committee has heavy representation those who benefit 
from current rules and lacks the diversity bring alternative viewpoints the debate 
see basic plan concerning streamlining and rationalizing commissions japanese 
cabinet office april 
rule thumb for evaluating the likely effectiveness committee might 
this says the effectiveness committee rises with the levels expertise 
diversity and with the share outsiders the committee outsiders 
number committee members which must exceed order guarantee sufficient 
diversity the effectiveness declines with the square the number members above 
transparency 
voters around the world have expressed frustration with the lack sufficient 
transparency government japan exception indeed one the key reasons for 
the two victories gov yuriko koike tokyo was the lack transparency the 
decisions that went into the location spending and oversight the bln initially 
estimated bln move the tokyo fish market the failure actually implement 
the planned landfills the site which was formerly chemical plant only added 
voter skepticism and fear for food safety 
ironically the japanese government quite transparent some respects there are 
extensive records deliberations government bodies all published the internet 
for example one can criticize the proposals the work style reform committee but 
one cannot criticize the disclosure 
however there remains great leeway for questionable activity even laws are 
broken public skepticism has worsened and abe himself after the ldp defeat 
the tokyo assembly election said that it been five years since this administration 
kicked off and believe the public has sent tough message that have lost our 
discipline however the real problem incentives the modus operandi for 
bureaucrats keep politicians under control can leaking otherwise non public 
information more comprehensive set standards for whistleblowing inside the 
government would enhance transparency deter such problems from arising and reduce 
the incentive use confidential information bureaucratic tool 
another transparency issue the press clubs individual ministries ministries are 
permitted restrict access journalists the club associated with their own 
ministry this system has long been target criticism and some reforms have 
occurred however remains barrier energetic coverage example the 
controversy around the lack landfills the toyosu site the new fish market 
more tenacious journalism culture could have exposed this problem long before 
became acute thus moves the government end this system would enhance 
functioning democracy and also aid confidence the economy 
gov koike was election july getting mln votes her ldp challenger received 
mln and the democratic party challenger mln thus she nearly achieved twice 
many the main opponents combined the election for the tokyo assembly july 
her newly formed party went from seats just before the election while the 
ldp went from seats the election 
see cabinet office minutes the february meeting the work style reform 
committee japanese extensive minutes all committee meetings were made 
public including the pm scolding the committee for slow progress this meeting

tax reform next steps needed 
abenomics has already made much progress corporate tax reform the statutory 
corporate income tax has been brought from just below 
perhaps more importantly change the tax treatment corporate spinoffs will 
encourage rationalization companies the impact these cuts suggested the 
continued rise business investment which has accelerated over the last few quarters 
however much remains done the current statutory corporate tax rate remains 
about points above the oecd average moreover both actual average tax levels 
and marginal taxes japanese corporate taxes remain high even after the recent tax cuts 
the issue particularly pressing for japan faster capital formation essential for 
raising productivity growth because new capital stock incorporates the latest 
technology apart from corporate income taxes the employer share social security 
taxes has been rising burden well these taxes have double negative impact the 
economy worsening the incentive expand business and making labor even more 
expensive course sustainability the social security system also important 
however sustainable social security system cannot achieved adverse incentives 
for economic activity see budget discussion below 
the statutory corporate income tax rate japan this compares the oecd 
average with standard deviation about pts for statutory tax rates 
see oecd statutory corporate income tax rate 
previously when firm spun off business unit the assets the unit had 
marked market and the valuation gain was taxed this was major barrier 
corporate rationalizations especially when the unit happened own real estate that 
had been purchased many years earlier under the new provisions the spinoff not 
required pay such tax 
study the congressional budget office for year showed that the average 
tax rate actually paid japan was compared the germany 
and france moreover the effective tax rate defined the percentage 
income from marginal investment that just profitable japan was compared 
the germany and france for details see congressional 
budget office international comparisons corporate tax rates march 
the degree capital formation needed achieve the abenomics goal real 
growth huge for details see japan economics can japan achieve long run real 
growth apr 
ironically the high social security tax burden may also promote substitution capital 
for labor however believe that this substitution effect small relative the 
negative impact business expansion 
budget spending reallocation 
among the government failures mentioned above silo decisions there strong 
tendency large organizations like governments for administrative units have 
largely fixed budget rules where vested interests are strong silo decision making leads 
inflexible budgets that fail address the changing balance among needs for 
example see exhibit total spending operational items excluding interest 
was about trl while spending social items medical pension welfare nursing 
care and unemployment was about trl the latest year that full data are 
available spending operational items was down about trl but spending 
social items had reached trl the operational figures would have been worse had 
interest expenditures not fallen much result low interest rates short silo 
decision making has starved operational items and ballooned social spending 
exhibit general government expenditure trl 
operational 
interest 
social spending 
source cabinet office annual report national accounts 
general rule spending that supports growth energy infrastructure 
education etc comes within the operational categories while the social categories are 
heavily skewed current consumption therefore the government support 
faster and more effective capital formation there needs reallocation away from 
social categories toward growth driving operational categories gestures have been 
made that direction budget formulation such the priority issue promotion 
tranche however the impact the measures the overall allocation spending 
has been quite limited 
credible pro growth budget policy would address the imbalance between current 
consumption the social budget and capacity building the operational budget 
without explicit policy establish balance investors will fear that social spending 
will exceed the ability the economy grow enough pay for 
program for similar that exhibit might reassure investors that fiscal 
discipline had been established and that the macroeconomics and microeconomics 
were again synchronized hold social spending growth about the growth rate 
nominal gdp but let operational spending grow the same rate gdp assume 
that higher interest rates will rais interest spending trl the result drop 
the share social welfare gdp even while the actual amount rises without 
explicit plan this nature even though specifics could differ investors could well 
decide that japan has not achieved economic fiscal sustainability

appendix labor deregulation will raise wages for both regular 
and non regular workers and improve the composition 
employment 
japan faces dual labor market the market for regular workers includes capital 
intensive firms with higher productivity but also subject onerous labor regulation 
see exhibit because large firms are capital intensive they pay high wages but have 
labor demand curve that steeply downward sloping the numerical example here 
with restricted supply regular workers due elite schooling etc the equilibrium 
with heavy regulation wage with workforce 
regular worker wage 
regular labor market 
lhs starting left 
non regular labor demand 
rhs starting right 
labor quantity 
non regular worker wage 
exhibit wages and employment the dual labor market 
source morgan stanley research 
the market for non regular workers unregulated and absorbs the rest the labor 
force the wage this market falls the level which the remaining workers 
everyone not employed the regular labor sector are all employed because the firms 
are less capital intensive the labor demand curve less steep the diagram where the 
market for non regular workers starts from the right hand side there are workers 
wage 
now say the government reduces regulation the regular labor market the reduction 
regulation pushes the demand curve for regular labor outward supply unchanged 
see exhibit this example the result that the regular labor market now takes 
workers wage about rise the non regular market there are 
fewer workers left since there are still only workers overall employment falls 
but the wage rises about rise 
regular worker wage 
removing regulation raises 
demand for labor the regular 
labor market therefore less labor 
available for the non regular 
market wages both markets 
rise 
labor quantity 
non regular worker wage 
exhibit impact deregulation the labor market wages rise shares shift toward higher 
paid work and inequality shrinks 
source morgan stanley research 
this result remarkable removing onerous regulation the market for regular 
workers raises wages for both regular and non regular workers and shifts the 
composition employment toward the higher paid sector moreover wage inequality 
actually shrinks with the original regulation regular workers earned the 
level non regular workers after deregulation regular worker earn the 
level non regular workers 
course the real world the positions and slopes the labor demand and supply 
curves will determine how employment and wages change however the qualitative 
results wage changes and labor allocation are clear inequality the key issue 
the relative slopes the two labor supply curves long labor supply for regular 
workers flatter than labor demand for non regular workers inequality will shrink 
light the fact that regular workers are paid much more that non regular workers 
seems likely that the relative slopes will reduce inequality when onerous labor 
regulation lifted
