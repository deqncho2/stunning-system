cric into the response phase 
japan has entered the response phase the cric cycle despite 
strong opposition abe likely prevail and push reforms 
forward 
japan cric entering the response phase after long period 
complacency and short sharp crisis originating recent events china 
the abe government reacting with new 
additional monetary easing least likely our view because price 
trends are clearly improving while the impact extra monetary stimulus 
demand questionable additional fiscal spending most likely 
supplementary budget about trl unison there will new round 
growth policies spurring private investment the crucial part since 
other sources demand growth exports consumption seem unlikely rise 
quickly positive surprise would major corporate income tax cut 
negative surprise would slow action labor market reform 
the first obstacles are political first the upper house election 
next year districts show even more voter disparity than the lower 
house and thus the politics elections tilt against economic reform 
there are shaky relations between the ruling ldp and its coalition partner the 
komeito within the ldp and komeito large groups still favor the medical 
welfare and special interest policies that have thwarted fiscal and structural 
reform 
exhibit cric cycle crisis response improvement and 
complacency 
rce rgan stan ley research 
exhibit recent cric cycle timeline 
the second obstacles are numerical achieving real growth will require 
capex growth over the next few years structural reform policies are 
not aggressive enough yet achieve this much less achieve while fiscal 
consolidation proceeds 
expect abe win the economic reform debates his track record 
impressive has faced down vested interests opposing agriculture 
corporate governance and labor law changes successful passage his 
national defense proposals seems highly likely this week however the 
contradiction between the economic necessity aggressive reform policy and 
the political necessity the upper house election will severe challenge 
maintain our stance abenomics trust but verify
