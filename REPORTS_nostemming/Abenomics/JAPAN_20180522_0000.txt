fiscal sustainability the crucial 
role healthcare reform 
japan annual policy outline the honebuto policy will 
published june key part will fiscal stability key part 
fiscal stability will healthcare reform analyze the 
japanese healthcare system and propose signposts for 
progress 
despite full employment japan still runs large fiscal deficits demographic 
trends shrink the labor force and raise healthcare costs reform the healthcare 
system crucial for fiscal stability 
government medical costs japan rose year from while 
nominal gdp grew year and now stand gdp posit 
scenarios how fiscal reform might impact healthcare spending healthcare 
subsectors and the rest the economy 
only about the rise healthcare costs stemmed from aging the 
population the other came from increased cost per head the rapid rise 
cost per head came largely from technology change and the interaction 
market failures and regulatory failures the healthcare industry 
policy cannot change demographics and demand characteristics but can 
change other factors the technology problem can addressed increasing 
and reallocating healthcare toward better cost benefit balance the 
market regulatory problems can addressed increasing competition 
among healthcare suppliers reducing asymmetry information between 
buyers and sellers reconnecting the payer now the national insurance 
system and the user the patient and broad use cost benefit analysis 
healthcare analysis 
the upcoming annual policy outline honebuto policy will likely focus 
fiscal reform the question whether the new honebuto will provide credible 
approach healthcare reform stick our long held view abenomics

executive summary 
addition the points the front page the following points summarize this paper 
fiscal adjustment requires difficult decisions even assuming adequate gdp growth 
stabilizing the ratio government debt gdp require some combination tax 
increases and spending cuts that generates total about trl improvement 
the primary balance the fiscal balance excluding interest costs all the 
adjustment came from the consumption tax then the tax rate would have about 
all the adjustment came from trl spending cuts the proportional 
cut healthcare spending would have about trl see exhibit 
large part the increase healthcare cost per head has come from technology 
change but technology change comes three types excellent beneficial and 
harmful the category for given technology change depends both income and price 
effects the income effect summarizes how much the technology change impacts 
healthy life span and earning power including that family caregivers the price effect 
summarizes how much the technology change impacts the price healthcare relative 
other goods and services the economy new technology with large positive income 
effect that also lowers the relative price healthcare goods would excellent 
innovation one that lowers income and raises the relative price healthcare goods 
could harmful innovation 
another large part the higher healthcare cost per head stems from the interaction 
market failures and regulatory failures the most important market failures are 
asymmetric information which gives suppliers undue influence relative buyers and 
market power suppliers which reduces competition and reduces choice buyers 
the most important regulatory failures are rent seeking interest groups and silobased decision making 
key signposts for evaluating upcoming policy proposals healthcare reform include 
thorough application cost benefit analysis the healthcare system 
introduction cap public spending healthcare share gdp 
supply chain simplification order reconnect payments for healthcare services 
the flows the services between supplier and buyer through individual healthcare 
accounts thorough reform policy advisory committees with reductions the

goal not sufficient achieve stable debt gdp ratio how much improvement 
the primary balance needed when the goal reduce the ratio government 
debt gdp the answer easy the primary balance must exceed interest costs 
net interest costs were about trl and the primary balance was deficit 
about trl thus improvement least trl about gdp 
would needed 
improving the government balance gdp already very large task however 
this amount likely understates the actually need for two reasons first the average 
interest rate net debt net interest payments divided net debt was 
only result highly accommodative monetary policy leaving the net interest 
rate terms footnote only japan escapes deflation the boj 
likely allow interest rates rise bond yields rise faster than nominal gdp growth 
that the term rises about the average the period then the 
improvement the primary balance needed for debt stabilization would not 
but rather the term returned the level then the needed 
adjustment the primary balance would balloon gdp

yields even the government successful achieving zero primary balance the 
reported new goal debt would likely rise further about trl 
current gdp there question whether investors will buy jgbs low yields the 
face mounting deficits particularly deflation ends and the bank japan 
eventually exits from the current low yield policy 
the how the question difficult choices about taxes and spending even supplyside growth policies are successful can japan really afford raise taxes light the 
adverse impact growth and incentives work and invest can japan really cut 
spending with aging the population increasing needs for both pensions and medical 
payments not mention defense needs needs and education needs 
the changes taxes and spending over the last decade are outlined exhibit total 
spending rose about trl from social spending accounted for the 
lion share trl this the rise medical spending was trl the increase 
spending operational items such defense education public safety and all other 
non social spending except interest payments was mere trl education spending 
actually fell moreover tax revenue could not keep with the rise total spending

reform plan can credible without major reforms the healthcare system the next 
question the macro scenarios healthcare reform 
healthcare fiscal adjustment scenarios 
should healthcare spending cut that question one for the japanese people 
answer but they cannot answer vacuum the decisions healthcare spending must 
made the context both tax hikes and other spending cuts the scenarios are 
suggested exhibit this calculation posit goal stabilizing the gross debt 
ratio the nation now about gdp also take longer term view 
using the period from the start liquid jgb market the introduction 
yield curve control the bank japan during this period averaged thus 
using the formula from the sidenote above stabilizing the debt gdp ratio would require 
primary surplus trl compared the deficit trl 
improvement about trl gdp how much this trl should come 
from tax hikes and how much from spending cuts 
taxes use the rule thumb that rise the consumption tax brings 
trl hence the entire adjustment came through consumption tax hikes the 
consumption tax rate would have rise from the current about with 
exemptions some exemptions for necessities are scheduled introduced into the 
consumption tax hence the stated rate consumption tax would have 
higher than this simple calculation implies exhibit this point labeled point 
the other end the spectrum say that the entire adjustment comes from spending 
cuts specifically from social spending cuts since the rest spending has already been 
tightly constrained this case the consumption tax would remain the present 
but social spending would cut trl healthcare were retain its current share

course interim choices are also possible shown the graph what would the 
japanese economy look like the various scenarios discuss scenarios and 
exhibit which reproduces exhibit the impact consumption would have 
broken into the income effect and the price effect and the impact investment would 
have broken into how investment changed the overall economy and how 
much changes corporate tax rates 
taxes are the sole method for achieving stable debt ratio then the income effect 
consumers will very large and the impact the economy well the experience 
the consumption tax hike would likely repeated with even greater impact 
moreover total reliance taxes suggests that relative price trends would not change 
much implying that prices healthcare goods would continue rise relative other 
goods since healthcare goods tend income inelastic the income effect these 
price hikes would fall largely other goods the impact investment would likely 
negative since the domestic economy would weaken this impact would strengthen 
some the tax hike came the form social security contributions which are split 
between employer and employee 
the other end the spectrum all the fiscal adjustment came from spending 
cuts there would sizable cuts pensions affecting all spending the elderly 
however some the market and regulatory failures see below would end thus 
improving incentives the system and improving resource allocation prices 
healthcare goods would likely fall relative other goods investment would 
spurred the parts the healthcare industry that serve the new needs private

why has healthcare spending risen 
why have healthcare costs risen much the most common explanation the aging 
the population after all since the elderly cost more per head increase the number 
elderly will raise total costs while true this explanation only somewhat less than 
half the story exhibit illustrates 
exhibit healthcare costs age group 
per capita cost 
the size each rectangle 
represents the total amount 
spent 
population mln 
source per capital healthcare costs from ministry health labor and welfare population data from ministry general affairs calculations morgan 
stanley 
exhibit the rectangle labeled shows total healthcare spending the elderly 
the width represents the elderly population and the height represents the cost per 
head there were mln japanese age older the average cost per 
head was yielding total spending about trl not only had the 
population the elderly risen mln but the per capita cost had also risen 
bringing total spending the elderly about trl thus the pure 
population effect the impact population rise the original unit cost was trl 
seems that about trl the total cost rise trl came from aging 
the remainder the cost increase 
about trl came from the interaction 
effect the two 
however this not quite right because the number non elderly fell the same 
calculation for the non elderly yields population effect negative trl the 
true population impact was actually trl about the total cost rise 
short aging caused only about the total rise healthcare costs between 
and where did the other come from the lion share trl came 
from higher unit costs for both the elderly and the non elderly indeed the growth 
rate unit costs for the non elderly was higher than that for the elderly 
moreover both these unit cost growth rates were far above the rise 
the consumer price index the same period 
symbols where total cost 
number services and number 
people then the 
first two terms comprise unit cost 
need examine 
how much the rise unit cost came 
from and how much from and 
must examine what supply and 
demand factors cause and 
move they did 
thus while the macro need for unit cost control clear closer look unit costs 
needed after all the quantity and mix services used different age groups will 
change with time and pricing more precisely unit cost equals cost service 
multiplied services person must examine the healthcare market more 
carefully this calls for some microeconomics 
the microeconomics healthcare 
microeconomic discussion healthcare must start with demand from individuals 
the goal healthcare health health form human capital that allows the 
individual earn more and enjoy other goods more one must sacrifice other 
goods services and leisure order invest health the investment health

tradeoff between healthcare and other goods this tradeoff can analyzed with 
the usual tools consumer theory see exhibit there will indifference curves

this graph consumer behavior raises two key issues for healthcare policy how 
consumers respond higher income how consumers respond higher 
healthcare prices 
there are several special things about healthcare demand lower levels income 
income elastic but higher levels income becomes income inelastic all 
ages price inelastic and individual ages preferences shift favor 
healthcare 
illustrate for high income elasticity when income rises from very low levels the 
budget line shifts outward and desired consumption healthcare rises more than 
proportionally illustrated exhibit income rises from the exhibit 
the path the tangency points accelerates upward starting from higher levels 
income exhibit however the income elasticity healthcare would low and 
desired consumption healthcare rises less than proportionally the resulting path

finally the impact relative prices consumption seen exhibit for given set 
preferences consumer higher prices for healthcare flatter budget line 
given level income will cause decline healthcare spending however since 
healthcare spending inelastic with respect prices the decline healthcare use less 
than proportional the rise healthcare prices 
healthcare 
exhibit impact rise the price healthcare 
the price healthcare rises 
from flatter budget line 
the individual consumes less 
both goods however since

how does this theory help have learned that the consumption healthcare 
relative other goods depends four factors the shape indifference curves 
individuals the mix individuals old young the income the individuals 
and the price healthcare relative other goods which may differ across 
individuals depending the payment scheme the healthcare insurance system 
these factors have practical implications for japan particular the mix individuals 
shifts toward the elderly there natural tendency for increased preference for 
healthcare relative other goods addition japan has relatively high payment 
the national insurance system for the young for those over and for 
those welfare who tend elderly hence the copayment system accelerates 
the rise healthcare demand brought aging 
there one more very unusual aspect healthcare consumption one the purposes 
healthcare spending enhance earning power though better health terms 
the diagrams above the budget line then ceases straight line but shifts outward 
incrementally the share healthcare consumption rises although such effect 
hard measure may significant indeed the continued rise the labor force 
participation rate the elderly japan over the last years from about 
may due part better health brought part more 
healthcare 
thus japan has enjoyed certain return healthcare when seen investment 
whether the return that investment was high compared other ways using the 
same funds within healthcare prevention instead treatment outside 
healthcare education much thornier question 
the impact technology 
key aspect unit cost growth japan everywhere else the impact 
technology close examination how technology changes consumer demand gives 
important hint about healthcare reform 
the fundamental impact technology healthcare comes the budget line but 
two forms one change the price some cases health conditions that were 
previously untreatable any price have become treatable even high price 
other cases technology can lower the price healthcare 
the other impact technology the budget line comes from the impact income 
some cases new treatments will improve health much that income actually increases 
one could argue that the increased participation rates the elderly japan stems 
part from this benefit healthcare technology other cases however the impact 
earning power may negligible even negative for treatments the very elderly 
who are longer working treatments that trigger workers quit jobs order 
take care family members short technology change will shift the slope and 
position the budget line illustrate three types technology change excellent 
beneficial and harmful 
excellent technology change seen exhibit this case the technology has had 
large and positive impact earning power shown the outward shift the 
budget line addition the new technology cheaper shown the lower price for 
heathcare steeper budget line the result that technology change raises 
consumption both healthcare and other goods the equilibrium moves the

markets for homogenous technologically mature products such chewing gum 
decisions healthcare are the result the interaction patient and family needs and 
incomes the healthcare supply industry and the insurance schemes that provide the 
financial incentives all parties next turn the supply side healthcare 
healthcare supply market failure and regulatory failure 
complex supply chain 
the healthcare supply chain enormously complex for several reasons first there are 
several major subcomponents such prevention treatment and care examples 
respectively would sports clubs hospitals and elderly care facilities each these 
subcomponents turn has many sub subcomponents second there strong 
geographic component many healthcare goods and services which tilts the 
competitive landscape toward monopoly third the regulatory environment differs 
across regions and products hence there not single market for healthcare services 
but rather large number balkanized markets that are connected complex ways 
the other two market failures 
commonly discussed are externalities and 
public goods

market failures 
healthcare markets are particularly prone market failures for number 
reasons for healthcare two most important market failures are market power and 
information asymmetry market power comes from small number suppliers 
relative demand and can the result economies scale 
for example there are clearly economies scale acute care hospitals and thus 
they tend large consequence this large size that areas with low 
populations there could only one such hospital one unusual result japan 
that hospital bed availability across japanese prefectures inversely proportional 
population for example the very rural koichi prefecture has beds 
population while the very urban kanagawa prefecture has population 
these disparities have triggered regulatory and market reactions ironically the 
result has been drop the total number general hospitals from 
short hospital supply has become more monopolistic 
information asymmetry comes from the difference between well trained 
experienced providers doctors nurses pharmacists and laymen patients the 
existence asymmetric information gives the supplier strong position when giving 
advice treatment patients this situation creates principal agent problem the 
provider agent should acting the best interests the patient principal but 
incentives both the reimbursement system and the insurance system can work 
the opposite direction 
the existence market failures creates presumption that regulation needed 
however regulation comes with its own risks namely regulatory failures several 
types 
the singaporean system provides interesting contrast 
see klein ezra singapore miracle healthcare system the 
answer for america the singapore model shows how 
liberal and conservative ideas can fuse april 
vox policy andpolitics singapore health care systemexplained 
regulatory failures 
the most prominent regulatory failure rent seeking when 
industry bodies seek government regulation and offer 
expertise the subject matter return for rules that limit 
competition grant other benefits this issue salient 
the japanese healthcare system where bodies such the 
japan medical association for doctors the japan 
pharmacists association and the japan nursing association 
have substantial influence rule setting particularly 
fraught aspect regulation drug pricing japan the 
minstry health labor and welfare mhlw has power 
control over drug prices drug approvals and drug usage 
negotiations over drug prices are particularly contentious 
especially when other parts the healthcare budget 
doctor remuneration are under consideration 
other regulatory failures are also important for example although expertise 
essential rule making bodies tend dominated producers and regulators with 
much less input from others rule making also done mostly silos that 
interactions decisions with other parts the economy even other parts the 
healthcare system are often given little weight and finally there often bundling 
rules that one must use entire set rules rather than ones that suit the 
consumer this issue has impacted japanese healthcare substantially witnessed 
the very slow progress allowing mixed treatment whereby both procedures covered 
national medical insurance and those not yet covered can carried out together 
under current rules when patient opts for non covered treatments the patient loses 
insurance coverage for all other treatments well 
system that similar japan quality but does not separate payments from 
service receivers that singapore all citizens and permanent residents singapore 
are required contribute individual medisave and medishield accounts from 
pretax earnings and pay fees doctors and institutions from these accounts and 
from other resources when necessary there national database prices for many 
procedures hospital public hospitals are required post prices and many private 
hospitals also order attract demand governments own the public hospitals 
outright the ministry health now maintains online calculators that patients 
may visit the website and estimate the cost treatment and calculate the share the 
bill that may financed medisave and medishield this flow information reduces 
the problem asymmetric information see the health care system singapore 
ramesh and azad singh bali 
another key feature the japanese 
healthcare system similar many 
around the world the extensive 
separation those who pay for 
healthcare services from those who 
actually receive the services exhibit 
even with the relatively large copayment for regular enrollees 
the true cost many healthcare 
services medications hospital stays 
doctor visits obscured from the user 
for the age group for whom the 
payment principle this 
distortion even greater since services 
must provided demand the user 
bases decisions small fraction 
the actual cost ironically consumers 
age and demand more medical services 
they have lower payments and thus 
face lower prices this the inverse 
normal market where demand for 
larger quantity requires higher price 
exhibit decoupling healthcare payments and services

technology and regulatory failure interact 
important element how technology and regulation 
interact japan technology change has had both positive 
and negative impacts healthcare supply positive 
example electronic billing systems for pharmaceuticals 
which now have nearly total penetration this advance has 
lowered the cost filling prescriptions substantially 
negative example seen recent drug pricing case 
groundbreaking but very expensive cancer drug was 
approved mhlw for limited application 
price about per patient per year about 
double the cost the where was initially developed 
subsequently the drug was approved for wider use 
japan including treatment lung cancer however the 
price was not reduced simultaneously and the total 
costs soared february mhlw cut the price half 
and april cut the price again result 
the japanese price now below that the united states 
although still somewhat higher than some countries 
europe 
light the outcome healthcare costs particularly the rise cost per head these 
market failures regulatory failures and incentive distortions the supply chain are 
key issue address regaining control costs the healthcare system and fiscal 
deficits 
japan international comparison 
another matter interest how the japanese supply chain compares that 
other countries healthcare systems are enormously complex and thus have many 
factors which comparison can made from the view point systemic 
efficiency however two are likely paramount importance the public share 
healthcare supply and the public share healthcare financing using oecd

source based sloan frank and chee ruey hsieh health economics second edition mit press underlying data from oecd 
most countries show shares more for both public financing and public supply 
however japan lies somewhat unusual position with very high share public 
financing but the comparatively low share public supply short japan the 
private sector supplies but the public sector pays 
one can argue that this combination leaves japan particularly vulnerable position 
the high share public financing leaves the country highly vulnerable regulatory 
failure the high share private supply leaves the country highly vulnerable market 
failures 
even excluding the united states

supply and the ratio population

final point whether these differences supply structure and financing impact

case the united states whose share healthcare spending lies standard 
deviations above the mean this sample nations neither the share the public 
sector finance nor supply has statistically significant impact the healthcare 
cost ratio however the share the elderly the population does this result 
suggests that the impact market failures and regulatory failures most clearly 
evident their impact the unit cost elderly care 
path sustainable healthcare spending 
japan current healthcare system combined with demographics not compatible with 
either macro debt sustainability vibrant macro growth the solutions however are 
fundamentally microeconomic nature and have four elements 
the demand side the nature healthcare makes both income and priceinelastic low price elasticity healthcare demand thus shifts the burden higher 
healthcare prices into wholly unrelated goods thus raising the price elasticity 
healthcare important element reform 
the supply side there are balkanized markets with many market failures 
regulatory failures and distorted incentives 
the financing healthcare japan decouples the demand for healthcare from 
payments for this decoupling encourages suboptimal use resources 
finally social norms often prevent open discussion cost benefit calculations 
order create more sustainable healthcare system all four elements need 
addressed moreover these four issues interact for example reforms the demand 
side often involve incentives which turn involve insurance reforms the supply 
side often involve financing and incentives supply address number these 
issues below 
incentive issues 
number key reforms require giving accurate price signals users healthcare 
services key distortion incentives the current japanese system the very low 
copayment for elderly healthcare thus the healthcare system lowers the price 
precisely the time that their demand rises there are many alternative systems some 
potential approaches copayments might include lower copayments for very rare 
diseases income dependent copayments much like progressive income taxes 
wealth dependent copayments very much like inheritance taxes and behaviordependent copayments such high copayments for lung cancer patients with history 
tobacco use japan has some modest use items and but does not use 
approaches and 
the system actually more complicated for details see mhlw iryo ichibu 
futan jiko futan wariai tsuite 
http mhlw bunya shakaihosho for the 
healthcare payment system administered health cooperatives the contribution 
income split equally between employer and employee there separate 
contribution for nursing care also split equally for those outside this 
system there people healthcare kokumin hoken system where payments are 
expressed yen month these differ substantially locality addition copayments 
the medical system are also quite complicated for those under the copayment 
from over however for those over with 
income over mln the copayment addition there are caps monthly 
payments based income 
under current law when patient under full care the national healthcare 
system dies with undiscovered assets the relatives the patient inherit the assets 
regardless how much the government insurance system paid for healthcare such 
cases the law could amended allow the insurance system recoup costs 
the moment healthcare premiums 
the japanese welfare insurance system 
are principle fixed proportion 
wage income this system could 
made more progressive just like income 
taxes the wealth tax component could 
also strengthened light the 
fact that earlier deductions medical 
insurance underestimated life spans 
and thus undercharged the insured 
population rather than taxing the work 
force for the errors long retired 
politicians and bureaucrats might 
fairer increase the burden 
recipients some legal changes might 
also needed 
the copayments system also 
extremely complex and might benefit 
from simplification costs could

conditions for excellent technology change one that both lowers the cost

inclusion some new tests annual healthcare check ups 
information issues 
among market failures those related asymmetric inadequate information loom 
largest given the complexity and scientific content healthcare issues consumers are 
natural disadvantage trained providers fortunately japan elsewhere the 
advance the internet and search engines has made information about healthcare far 
more available consumers addition far easier obtain quality rankings 
healthcare institutions that consumers can make more informed choices since access 
such information easy there does not seem strong case for government 
intervention improve access even more 
there may case however improve the quality information for this purpose 
further integration databases could helpful heretofore concerns about patient 
privacy have limited the integration healthcare databases but here well blockchain 
technology could prove useful databases could designed mask private 
information but still allow meaningful data analysis users 
for example the signal and the noise penguin books nate silver gives 
excellent example population women their there were 
cases women who had breast cancer these had positive results certain 
test standard terminology the sensitivity this test very high this the 
probability that patient with cancer gets positive result however this ratio 
very little use the patient the patient needs know the probability that someone 
with positive test actually has cancer the sample cited silver there were 
actually positive test results these actually had cancer the positive 
predictive value which might better termed the true positive ratio actually only 
perhaps more important would

evaluate data effort raise

results might helpful truth

among the most vexing issues 
healthcare end life care equally 
vexing the widespread disagreement 
among experts whether the issue 
extremely high costs the very end 
life the high costs treating those 
with chronic debilitating diseases over 
the last few years life note that the 
elderly are not the only group involved 
there can very high costs for 
extremely young children the 
focus changing from elderly care 
chronic care 
for japan this issue crucial because the increasing 
spending nursing care facilities indeed from the 
introduction public nursing care insurance japan 
until the latest data government spending 
nursing care rose from trl trl cagr 
compared drop for nominal gdp hence 
nursing care spending now takes nearly japanese 
gdp double the amount spent defense that said 
part the motivation for introducing the nursing care 
system was reduce the usage full fledged medical 
facilities for low intensity nursing care and thus save costs 
careful statistical studies suggest that the scope for 
reducing total costs significant however the total 
spending nursing care high that more effort 
needed provide efficient services 
the end this debate comes down question cost benefit analysis concept 
that social norms japan have far largely excluded from the debate healthcare 
indeed the concept could applied wide variety healthcare issues the crucial 
point decisions healthcare need made the context cost sharing scheme 
with rational incentives for example copayments could adjusted reflect the age 
profile and recovery prospects the patient concerned 
the calculation qalys nice gives the following 
example compared old treatment new treatment 
extends life from years years and 
improves quality life from subjective opinion 
patients qalys rise from 
thus there incremental qaly years 
the incremental cost the treatment hence 
the incremental cost per qaly gpb 
and thus the treatment would recommended 
the threshold necessarily controversial study 
suggested that the threshold lowered about 
the reason that high thresholds for new drugs 
exhaust budgets and thus deny treatment others see

and effectively exhausts budgets 
japan mhlw beginning address the issue costbenefit analysis although tentatively and with some fierce 
opposition the central social insurance medical 
council csimc known chuikyo japanese which 
one the seven major healthcare advisory bodies 
mhlw began consideration cost benefit analysis the 
japanese healthcare system the committee made 
recommendations for trial introduction such analysis 
using the terminology icers and qalys decision 
implementing cost benefit analysis for drugs was due 
april however december the csimc 
subcommittee the matter could reach consensus the 
medical profession representatives opposed the 
introduction and the insurance representatives supported 
result the committee postponed the decision until 
year end 
signposts healthcare reform and the cric cycle 
for investors particularly macro investors interested fiscal sustainability there are 
several signposts that will indicate whether control healthcare costs proceeding 
first will there thorough review the incentives the pricing system for 
healthcare the current system prices services lower for those with the greatest 
demand moreover there virtually linkage healthcare premiums the behavior 
the individual advances have made such linkages easy cheap and secure 
moreover closer linkage payments those receiving services would likely improve 
resource use the singaporean system could provide good model 
second more thorough investigation the impact technology change costs 
and health our classification technology change into excellent beneficial and 
harmful changes could form the basis for such evaluation 
third steps address information asymmetry better information for patients and 
families would aid more rational decisions addition better knowledge how use 
statistical information could also aid decisions 
two instances highly successful 
small committees japan have been the 
kinyu mondai tasukufohsu financial 
problem task force which outlined the 
blueprint for financial system 
restructuring and the 
denryoku gasu torihiki kanshi iinkai 
electricity and gas market surveillence 
commission which now oversees the 
electric power industry both committees 
were formed the result severe 
stress the financial system bankruptcies 
the late and the fukushima 
nuclear accident 
fourth radically simplified regulatory structure for healthcare the current 
system large complex and opaque and thus highly vulnerable both market 
and regulatory failure might advisable sharply cut the number advisory 
bodies and sharply cut the number members each remaining committee 
moreover also important balance the expertise industry professionals with 
independent outsider voices that represent the general public key 
characteristics successful committees include small number members 
high density independent not related suppliers members and strong 
independence from political interference 
fifth thorough use cost benefit analysis all aspects healthcare system 
evaluation 
finally hard cap healthcare spending the government the budget 
decisions made every year such limit overall healthcare spending might the 
best way ensure that efficient decisions are taken within the healthcare system 
and not imposed unwittingly other sections the government budget 
obesity japan far lower than 
other industrial countries the oecd 
reports that the overall obesity rate 
japan was compared 
germany and the 
untied states see oecd obesity 
update 
oecd org els healthsystems obesity update pdf 
recent health exam the doctor told this 
author that the result was not bad for 
american 
will these measures actually taken our answer yes but japan does 
have history making rational decisions some parts healthcare control 
prescription medicine prices strict most cases and has held down costs overall 
japan makes annual health check ups mandatory for most employees including 
metabo check for obesity 
however the procedures for decision making are complex and subject influence 
from vested interests there are also longstanding connections between politicians 
and healthcare supplier organizations moreover the transparency decision 
making rules could improved finally the relatively low out pocket costs 
for healthcare under the current remuneration system sharply lower the incentive 
for popular involvement healthcare system decisions 
the pace reform will depend significant extent macroeconomic factors our 
cric cycle model suggests that major social disruption may needed order 
raise public awareness and thus tilt the balance favor more rapid healthcare 
reform this was the case with two comparable historical problems the financial crisis 
the which had been brewing since the stock market crash and the 
fukushima accident where close ties between regulators and industry prevented 
the implementation accurate assessment risks
