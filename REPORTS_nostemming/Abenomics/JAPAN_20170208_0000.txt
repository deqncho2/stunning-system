without unemployment would not the current 
demographics make domestic labor even more scarce 
foreign labor will become even more vital 
macroeconomics foreign labor japan there were mln foreign workers 
japan rise from the previous year looking forward 
foreign labor will likely rise further because labor intensive service demand will 
rise even domestic labor supply shrinks however the rise foreign labor will 
likely offset only part domestic demographic pressures result the 
unemployment rate will likely continue fall and pressure wages and prices 
upward 
microeconomics foreign labor there absolute limit the total labor 
supply from domestic population foreign workers allow higher gdp when 
domestic labor becomes scarce and thus are crucial sustaining growth 
who are the foreign workers origin country origin about foreign 
workers come from major asia pac sources about from china the 
total increment last year vietnam provided with about 
each from china and the philippines location location foreign 
workers are heavily concentrated major urban areas the tokyo area alone 
takes and the concentration tokyo has increased over the years nonurban areas take only about despite the needs the very elderly 
population non urban areas industry occupation labor intensive industries

the macroeconomics foreign labor 
foreign labor already vital for the japanese economy end october there 
were mln foreign workers japan rise from the previous year 
which turn had seen rise see exhibit the large increases began the 
early but accelerated sharply with the start abenomics the current 
level foreign workers japan equivalent about total employment 
compared with only 
exhibit foreign workers japan thousand persons 
the importance foreign labor can seen with simple 
calculation the level real gdp labor demand was 
mln the total labor force was mln the 
unemployment rate was however had 
the foreign labor not come japan then the labor force would 
have been only mln with labor demand set the current 
level gdp the unemployment rate would have been such level would the lowest since 
thousand persons 
thus key question for the sustainability japanese growth 
without more foreign workers will domestic workers sufficient 
supply the labor needed for gdp growth the main domestic 
sources labor supply would prime age women and 
the elderly both genders

for prime age women there has already been sharp upward 
shift the age profile labor force participation rates see 
exhibit for the average increase was pts per 
year for women the age group the participation 
rate was but the rate was higher than the 
comparable age group the which was indeed with 
the small exceptions the and age groups japanese 
female participation rates for prime age women are higher than 
those the given the high level female participation rates 
already seems unlikely that the longer term pace upward 
movement pts year could maintained even this 
pace the addition would only per year and would 
wane the population ages 
for the elderly the calculation more complex there were about mln 
persons aged the labor force unfortunately there are official figures for the 
specific older age groups hence make the reasonable assumption that most 
these workers are the age group which had population about mln 
thus our estimated participation rate for older workers was the question 
whether this participation rate can higher exhibit hint 
exhibit older labor force and estimated participation rate 
labor force lhs 
pop rhs 
source cabinet office and morgan stanley research calculations 
the exhibit shows that the participation rate for the elderly the highest since 
period when large part the elderly population was still engaged 
agriculture the most recent trough was and since then the ratio has 
risen pts about per year continued increase this pace would 
add about workers per year 
what about demand for labor total employment now mln growth labor 
demand equal growth real gdp minus the growth labor productivity for 
example real gdp grows and productivity then labor demand 
growth this growth labor demand translates into about 
workers 
thus for each real gdp growth demand domestic supply would 
optimistically per year from higher female participation and from 
continued rise elderly participation that per year not enough the gap 
minimum would have made from either higher productivity 
growth more foreign workers 
unfortunately recent years labor productivity has not been visibly accelerating 
indeed curve analysis suggests that the productivity growth rate has been about 
moreover while more elderly workers may ease the labor shortage they are 
general less flexible learning new technologies and techniques which turn will 
constrain productivity growth further short without rapid success for the third 
arrow abenomics accelerating economy wide productivity growth even optimistic 
assumptions about domestic labor supply will not provide enough labor for even 
real growth much less the that abenomics targeting wage and price trends need 
considered this context 
the entire population above were used the denominator the participation rate 
for the elderly would fall because very few people work past even though the 
population above growing rapidly therefore although the calculation bit 
rough use the total labor force above the numerator and the population 
the denominator

exhibit foreign workers have been key cushion for labor 
supply 
the impact foreign labor supply the macro balance 
illustrated exhibit the cushion provided foreign labor has 
thickened even domestic labor supply has waned this cushion 
has been crucial meeting increased demand for labor 
particularly since the start abenomics what would the 
japanese economy have looked like without this foreign labor 
without the cushion foreign labor japanese labor markets 
would have been much tighter than they already are this can

rate the absence the foreign labor cushion see exhibit

our current economic forecast foresee the overall 
unemployment rate including foreign workers the labor force 
falling end this itself could trigger significant 
upward pressure wages using simple phillips curve analysis 
exhibit that unemployment rate should 
generate hourly wage growth about actual wage growth 
undershot this modestly moving average through 
should the unemployment rate fall our predicted 
level then the implied hourly wage growth would even 
with foreign workers what would such wage growth mean for 
core inflation 
act unemployment rate 
the relationship between hourly wages and core inflation 
shown exhibit core inflation using the new boj measure has 
strong correlation with hourly wages but this correlation can disrupted 
exchange rate changes and other shocks the key point that prices not move onefor one with hourly wages firms are continuously innovating order hold prices 
down relative wage movements that said the slope the line implies that 
hourly wage growth implies boj core price increases about 
source ministry internal affairs and communications and morgan stanley research calculations 
this context the importance foreign labor becomes massive with foreign labor 
the unemployment rate would likely about using the phillips curve the implies 
wage growth rate would and the implied boj core price increase would 
such outcome seems highly unlikely since monetary and fiscal policy would 
almost surely intervene stop such high inflation however the calculation does give 
clear sense how vital foreign labor has become japan

the microeconomics foreign labor 
the elementary microeconomics foreign labor shown exhibit let start with 
closed labor market domestic workers only since there absolute limit the 
total labor supply from domestic population the supply curve becomes vertical this 
limit labor demand determined the level the wage and the aggregate economy 
which will shift the curve when economic activity changes given level activity 
higher wage will induce firms offshore their production lower wage will induce 
firms produce home hence the labor demand curve downward sloping the 
equilibrium wage and quantity labor will point where supply equals demand

next let the labor market open foreign workers the foreign 
labor will begin enter the country when the wages pass 
certain level total labor supply will the horizontal sum 
domestic and foreign labor the new equilibrium will point 
where demand equals augmented supply this point total 
employment much higher however domestic employment 
slightly lower important note that the foreign workers 
have not taken jobs from domestic workers rather the impact 
foreign workers wages has made some domestic workers 
unwilling work 
what happens when the nation ages the labor market this 
means that the absolute limit total domestic labor supply has 
fallen thus the entire domestic supply curve moves inward 
exhibit the new equilibrium without foreign labor would 
point wages would much higher but total employment 
lower however aged economy with foreign workers the 
new equilibrium would point wages are higher than 
before and the diagram higher than the domestic only wage 
before the aging occurred total employment lower but foreign 
workers have increased order offset the impact aging 
what has happened labor income surprisingly the answer 
does not depend supply but rather the elasticity the 
demand curve point lies the inelastic part the demand 
curve the lower right then the move from point point will lower total labor 
income that the increase employment would too small offset the drop 
wages total income would fall course point lies the elastic part the 
demand curve upper left the total labor income would rise the same reasoning 
what happens when the society ages the aged society the economy more likely 
the elastic part the demand curve upper left the diagram this region 
when foreign workers enter the market total labor income rises that the decline 
the wage has smaller impact than the increase quantity total employment there 
interesting implication countries age allowing more foreign workers will 
preserve industry home and raise total labor income keynesian feedback effect 
could also outside the structure this model shift the labor demand curve outward 
and raise wages further 
these aspects the model suggest that the sharp rise foreign workers japan 
highly rational response aging the population this true both for japan and for 
the foreign workers who come even the average wage japan may somewhat 
lower than without the foreign workers the preservation total employment within 
the country benefit for the economy 
with lower labor income gdp could also fall and thus shift the labor demand curve 
inward however since this microeconomic model take gdp given the 
labor demand curve fixed 
who are the foreign workers 
while informative the micro model merely aggregation the domestic labor market 
for japan actually the aggregation many small imperfectly substituting labor 
markets across the nation even domestic supply constrained local factors such 
domestic labor mobility mismatched skill sets and age structure this even more true 
for foreign labor supply understanding how these factors may impact japan requires 
description where the foreign labor comes from where lives and what does 
where does foreign labor come from the sources foreign labor japan are shown 
exhibit exhibit and exhibit the shares have changed quite sharply since the 
lehman shock for example china and hong kong provided total 
foreign workers although more workers from china have flowed into japan the pace 
has been well below average result the share foreign workers from china has 
fallen one likely reason for the relatively slow pace immigration may 
better job opportunities home light continued chinese economic growth also 
important has been the weakening the yen earning yen makes less sense when the 
value the yen weak contrast the big share gain went asia pacific countries 
the largest increment came from vietnam out the total increment 
this trend likely has more with domestic economic conditions and 
increased openness the japanese economy rather than exchange rates

contrast the number foreign workers from latin america has hardly changed since 
this stagnation may due mostly the worsened reputation japan 
destination for foreign work light the post lehman experience that time many 
latam workers were paid home condition that they not return japan 
looking forward japan could remain preferred destination for foreign workers for 
number reasons first japan enjoys political stability and lack internal conflict 
these characteristics are more valuable world where conflict and anti immigrant 
sentiment growing second economic conditions home countries could become 
more difficult the world economy adjusts new geopolitical realities third the

stimulants there also economy scale supply once foreign workers from

what industries use foreign labor the final question what industries use foreign 
labor the answer has changed over the last decade see exhibit 
manufacturing and labor intensive industries construction retail wholesale 
hotels restaurants services had roughly the same number foreign workers however 
with globalization production the incremental need for manufacturing workers 
japan slowed contrast industries that cannot outsource basic activities hotels 
the need for labor continued rise short manufacturing the jobs went the 
labor other industries the labor came the jobs

looking forward this trend allocation foreign labor likely continue 
economies mature there rise the demand for services which are relatively labor 
intensive thus just when japan suffering from labor shortage the need for labor 
increasing the rational outcome rise foreign workers thus the continued rise 
share foreign workers the labor intensive industries likely continue
