energy long trek the best mix 
the best mix start with the global context 
japan price taker energy therefore japan energy 
future will depend very heavily global trends demand and 
supply which will determine prices various energy 
resources determining the best mix resources starts with 
view the long term trend global energy prices 
predicting long term energy prices notoriously difficult but 
very lucid framework for forecasting available the called 
kaya equation this approach was originally used examining 
the relationship energy use and but can easily 
adapted overall energy use 
the energy use version the kaya equation simple but 
powerful relationship total energy use three determinants 
population living standards and energy intensity 
that total energy use equals energy intensity 
amount energy used per unit real gdp multiplied the 
standard living the level real gdp per capita 
multiplied the population using this framework

for the morgan stanley view global oil prices see longson adam and 
elizabeth volynsky crude oil likely gets worse before gets better 
morgan stanley december while energy prices may have fallen recently 
for the short term believe that the medium and long term trends are firmly 
upward forecast brent prices back bbl with bear case 
and bull case 
see kaya yoichi cited tester sustainable energy 
choosing among options mit press the original kaya equation 
where population gdp energy and emissions 
over the last years world energy use grew about per 
year this result came from population growth somewhat 
above living standard growth also above offset part 
improvement energy efficiency bit less than 
japan energy use also grew but half the global rate the 
main difference was that population growth was very low while 
living standard improvements and efficiency gains were close 
world averages 
decade however the performance was quite different 
particular the period interesting because this 
when the real price oil rose began rise consistently 
seen appendix total energy use accelerated during this 
period because the sharp acceleration global living 
standards and the deceleration energy 
efficiency growth from year improvement 
modest deceleration population growth from 
helped hold energy growth down but was not enough stop 
the acceleration total energy use for japan this decade 
was also different total energy use actually declined despite 
modest population increase because energy efficiency 
improved much again beating the world standard 
energy use scenarios 
that was then when looking forward the first step specify 
global scenarios for population living standard and energy 
efficiency growth rates once energy growth scenario 
created the path cumulated amount energy demand 
can compared supply with implications for the price path 
this scenario exercise sets the context for japanese energy 
policy 
exhibit shows scenarios for global energy use using two sets 
assumptions that the world looks like the overall 
period and that the world looks like the 
period the former scenario energy use grows 
the same rate and thus total energy 
use rises from about bboe bboe 
the latter scenario total energy use rises the same rate 
and thus goes bboe

combination three changes lower negative 
population growth lower negative living standard growth

with higher efficiency growth would provide stable world 
economy 
short despite low oil prices now over the longer term the 
world will likely face vital need for faster discovery new 
cheap energy resources and faster development new 
cheap energy technologies generation storage 
distribution and conservation the former seems unlikely 
indeed cancellation energy projects the united states 
and elsewhere the face recent lower oil prices suggests 
exactly the opposite the latter possible but requires huge 
investments science technology and infrastructure using 
money that fiscally strapped industrial nations will not find 
easily 
this reality the twin hurdles resource constraints and 
budget constraints will the context which japan like 
every other country must formulate energy policy the best 
mix for japanese energy policy will the mix that both adapts 
the new reality and applies human intelligence change 
reality 
there good news and bad news the bad news that 
implementing energy transition will difficult and 
expensive the good news that japan has done this before 
indeed twice the last years see appendix the 
prospects for successful energy policy for choosing 
optimal energy mix and implementing depend very much 
clear understanding the tradeoffs both the economics 
and politics energy policy 
what are the tradeoffs and how can best mix determined 
the macro economics and politics the best mix

the social tradeoff harder society must come decision

combinations that they show diminishing marginal returns 
first everyone prefers lower pollution the question how 
much extra cost society willing bear order achieve 
incremental cut pollution second pollution goes down 
the willingness society bear extra costs recedes thus the 
social tradeoff line will curved because both cost and

balloon outward that for each increment lower pollution 
society willing pay only smaller and smaller amounts

japan not happy with this choice but there are two schools 
unhappiness see exhibit the nuclear school believes 
that the cost and pollution levels the current mix could 
reduced most quickly restart nuclear facilities the 
nuclear school believes that with nuclear restarts the cost 
curve would lower and flatter than the current choice 
suggests thus the best mix would mean that the country 
moves from point actual point the exhibit 
nuclear restarts are likely slowly foresee only 
single digit numbers reactors restarting during 
light scientific economic and political factors moreover the 
restart process also slowed severe shortage 
personnel the nuclear regulatory commission this 
summer expect decisions whether decommission 
apply extend operation for the seven reactors with service 
age greater than years 
the renewables school disagrees two counts first 
believes higher nuclear share shift the cost curve outward 
and make steeper that more nuclear power would raise 
pollution light the nuclear accidents nuclear waste 
problems etc and costs well light the burden 
retrofitting current nuclear reactors order ensure safety 
and the burden decommissioning reactors point 
second they believe that larger share renewables 
desirable even higher total cost for the renewables 
school the best mix point 
this disagreement about the best mix may seem intractable 
but not indeed japan has faced the issue best energy 
mix twice over the last years and moved aggressively 
toward optimal mix given technology and price environments 
each period making the macro decision however not 
enough implementing the decision requires more

how much energy used each stage the energy nexus 
the answer for japan given exhibit total 
primary energy use was about about the 
primary energy comes from extractives the total amount 
roughly was used for production fuels and for 
electricity these production processes some energy lost 
key feature the energy nexus the degree loss for 
fuels the loss relatively small about for electricity the 
loss very large about after these losses there are 
energy fuels and electricity 
the next stage the remaining fuel and electricity 
are distributed transportation and non transport uses 
heating lighting powering machinery etc somewhat 
surprisingly only about the fuel goes 
transportation contrast very little the electricity used 
transportation while almost all goes for non transport uses

japan energy nexus the first bottleneck energy intensity 
gdp for transportation this intensity the product two 
factors the mileage energy used per kilometer traveled and 
movement the number kilometers travel needed per unit 
gdp improving vehicle mileage has been focus 
research and policy for many years and major improvements 
have occurred however much less attention paid 
movement which could improved better land use more 
compact cities better inventory controls and better delivery 
algorithms 
japan has made many strides transport efficiency the 
heavy reliance rail for passenger traffic has been major 
policy success moreover auto mileage has improved 
remarkably between and average mileage for 
gasoline passenger cars rose from 
mpg mpg 
based the called mode mileage estimation method the 
based estimates are almost higher than the more recent standard see

for non transport intensity the product two analogous 
factors unit intensity and unit quantity each 
sub category for example residential use the factors are 
unit intensity energy used per square meter floor space for 
heating air conditioning per cubic foot refrigerator 
volume rice cooker capacity etc and unit quantity total floor 
space size refrigerators rice cookers etc historically 
japan has had small residences low unit quantity but 
poor unit intensity high energy use per square foot recent 
buildings have seen major improvements such the drop 
total electricity use for heating and air conditioning 
however overall unit intensity the residential area still has 
much room for improvement 
the meantime the electric conversion efficiency solar cells 
has been improving sharply and rapidly for example the 
cigs cell started with efficiency about and has 
now risen about the two junction concentrator cell 
started about and has now risen the 
three junction concentrator cell started with efficiency about 
but now has achieved about recently 
four junction more cells have achieved these results 
refer research labs but efficiency also improving more 
practical level colleagues point out that american solar 
firm projects conversion efficiency its products rise from 
about about similar results 
apply japanese firms 
the second obvious bottleneck conversion losses 
electricity the average conversion loss electricity 
generation about efficiency ratio only 
even use extractives continues better conversion 
efficiency would reduce both cost and pollution thus reducing 
conversion loss should important focus energy policy 
unfortunately the newly announced proposals may backfire 
meti reportedly proposing higher efficiency standards for 
newly built and built thermal power but not for legacy 
plants such incentive structure would actually discourage 
new plants and extend the lives old inefficient ones meti 
goal laudable but the measures are likely harmful 
the fourth bottleneck electricity storage the laboratory 
level several eye popping improvements lithium ion 
batteries are under research more practical level some 
new technologies could challenging industries based 
current technologies both transportation electric cars 
and power generation should electricity storage technology 
advance more rapidly than expected the intermittency problem 
that plagues renewable energy could reduced substantially 
the consequences remain uncertain but are coming into 
investor decision making 
the third bottleneck less visible how lower the share 
extractives which are pollution intense electricity 
generation one problem the public perception that electricity 
clean but this perception not necessarily correct the 
cleanliness electricity depends crucially the primary 
energy used produce long electricity produced 
mostly with extractives electricity cannot considered clean 
even conversion efficiency were raised 
meti reports that average power use for standard room through the year 
heating and cooling seasons put together fell from kwh kwh 
see meti agency for natural resources and energy whitepaper 
for example study prof yuzo sakamoto tokyo university calculated 
that shifting windows the mln houses with aluminum sashes plastic 
sashes would reduce emissions about mln tons reported the 
plastic sash association japan sash for the average house this 
would save per year about this compares the 
average electric bill about source mic household 
survey 
this international problem for example the energy information agency 
the estimates that the loss coal and nuclear electricity generation were 
about compared natural gas generated electricity 
reported the nikkei shimbun february 
for example the energy nexus for japan shows that shift total 
energy use from fuel electricity would result increased use extractive 
energy about the lower use fuel reduces extractive use about 
the but the higher use electricity increases extractive use about 
the share extractives electricity times the increased primary 
energy needed light large electricity conversion losses that said the 
thermal efficiency the electric machine for exceeds that the fuel based 
machine this would not the case shift electvicity would lower pollution

japan really finding the best mix how judge progress 
energy policy back the top the policy agenda the profit 
situation power companies has triggered demands for 
further electricity price hikes even while consumers and 
businesses are suffering from earlier hikes recently proposed 
price cuts light recent lower global oil prices would 
reverse only part the rise since the slowness 
decisions about restarting nuclear reactors has highlighted the 
scientific economic and political problems associated with 
that power source globally natural gas supply under threat 
from geopolitical disturbances even oil glut which 
think temporary pushes oil prices down the government 
scheduled update its basic energy policy the spring 
following last year document which was widely criticized 
ambiguous and unfocused 
what would the optimal energy policy look like the history 
and analysis above suggests three elements 
first impartial cost estimates 
the harsh debate between nuke school and the renewables 
school demonstrates the lack accurate and impartial data 
both costs and pollution levels for the alternative technologies 
some investors regard meti biased player heavily 
reliant the current energy industry for support and 
information for example meti power generation cost 
verification working group will reportedly raise the estimated 
cost solar power including the cost thermal facilities 
that are displaced highly questionable accounting method 
that would further disadvantage solar power thus 
independent cost estimates are needed addition despite 
many opinion polls there frustrating lack information 
how much the public would willing pay order promote 
cleaner cheaper energy 
second break the four bottlenecks 
the first bottleneck conversion primary energy 
electricity the japanese capital stock fossil fuel based 
electricity production very old indeed many moth balled 
generation plants were revived the wake the nuclear 
accidents since the pace nuclear restarts remains very 
uncertain policy trying reduce the burden nuclear 
facilities power companies and encourage more efficient 
see longson adam cit 
see nikkei shimbun march

fossil plants rose from total plants see

hatsuden shimeru rokyu karyoku wariai share obsolete thermal 
plants operation figure the energy white paper 
http enecho meti about whitepaper 
non nuclear alternatives this regard recent lng based 
generation plants and lower pollution coal fired plants are 
promising 
the second bottleneck intensity energy use gdp 
particularly outside transportation indeed while progress 
transportation still possible japan already has one the 
least energy intensive transportation sectors among major 
countries due the high share passenger rail traffic 
rather good energy policy would focus more improving 
energy efficiency outside transportation industry could still 
make major improvements through replacement old capital 
stock this even more true the residential sector where 
the energy efficiency new structures better than those 
being replaced urban planning could also help although 
japan making strides compact cities more effort 
regional economies concentration elderly population 
which service intensive could pay for itself saved energy 
costs 
the third bottleneck sourcing primary energy used for 
electricity levelized cost basis running costs capital 
costs and pollution costs must all considered before 
rational decisions can made historically the levelized cost 
nuclear power was underestimated and its potential 
pollution costs vastly underestimated these errors led not only 
excess reliance nuclear power but also starvation 
for other energy opportunities the good news that 
japan does have active policy promoting renewable 
energy especially for electricity the bad news that the 
policy seems waning for two reasons first the focus 
restarting nuclear facilities diverting attention from other 
opportunities second vested interests the power industry 
are exerting pressure quash potential competition 
the fourth bottleneck storage and distribution electricity 
japan moving forward slowly with lowering the east west 
barrier electricity distribution moreover there some 
experimentation with small grid electricity exchanges 
meti has recognized this problem recent proposal enforce higher 
generation efficiency standards however reported far these standards 
would only apply newly built plants thus leaving the older less efficient plants 
with competitive advantage long they remain inefficient thus the 
incentives the meti plan are exactly backward from those needed achieve 
the stated goal more cynical interpretation would wonder whether the new 
rules might intended prevent competition from new entrants thus protecting 
the current suppliers 
for historical reasons east japan uses cycle current and west japan uses 
cycle current there very little capacity share electricity across the 
east west divide this lack capacity share was critical weakness when the 
march earthquake sharply reduced electricity supply east japan

however revolutionary technology initiatives battery 
storage improvements seem underemphasized the 
policy agenda 
third show the money 
japan energy budget often misinterpreted because the 
complex accounting system the government there are 
several hurdles understanding actual energy spending 
the initial hurdle the distinction between general and special 
accounts the central government the general account 
the central government often the focus attention but fact 
much the real activity concentrated special accounts 
this very much true the energy field most the actual 
policy spending done through the energy measures special 
account enerugi taisaku tokubetsu kaikei which has three 
sub accounts and funded contributions from several 
ministries spending this account dwarfs the actual 
spending the general account 
the next hurdle the large amounts transfers among 
different government entities these transfers must filtered 
out before accurate figures can derived 
consider only the central government and its special accounts local 
governments may also spend some funds energy but these amounts are 
likely low and also likely funded transfers from the central 
government thus the figures from the central government are likely 
reliable indicators total energy spending 
another confusion that total spending for these accounts listed 
government documents includes repayment debt part total expenditure 
the case the energy measures special account this item constitutes about 
half total expenditure 
the final hurdle that total spending during fiscal year 
depends not only the initial budget but also the 
supplementary budget the case energy spending the 
supplementary budgets are often the largest sources funds 
thus clear picture energy spending can only seen from 
budget settlement data which are often not available until 
months after the close the fiscal year and after the labyrinth 
intra government accounting navigated 
our calculation actual energy spending the japanese 
government exhibit calculate total energy 
spending about trl and budget

size and allocation the size problem seen when the energy 
budget compared other government activities while 
trl sizable amount only the size social

what explains such price movements exhibits illustrates 
schematic supply demand analysis before both energy 
demand and supply expanded but supply expanded faster 
the faster growth supply brought prices down after the 
disruptions the the demand grew moderately faster 
than supply and the price rose although moderately after 
however two things changed there emerged major 
new energy demands from developing nations and supply 
growth slowed incremental supply came from more 
expensive sources short demand outpaced supply 
wide margin and therefore the price rose quite substantially

why did the shares different energy sources change 
much and often the reasons that the best mix changed 
the past were the same the reasons for the debate now 
changing prices changing technology and changing social 
preferences 
long term price data comparable basis are not available 
but trade data comparable since include abundant 
evidence relative prices exhibit prior the first oil 
crisis coal prices were very high and oil prices low 
moreover the tragic pollution cases the and 
produced social consensus lower pollution thus the 
was only natural that oil replace coal 
after however coal prices fell sharply with new global 
resource projects while oil rose sharply addition japan 
implemented pollution abatement measures order reduce 
the social impact coal use the rise the nuclear and lng 
shares after was less about price than about the need 
diversify energy sources and the low perceived pollution levels 
associated with these two sources after relative oil 
prices rose light emerging economy demand both lng 
and coal had clear cost advantages 
and then came fukushima the nuclear accidents march 
virtually eliminated nuclear power energy source 
requiring japan scramble for other energy sources and 
enhance conservation compared the energy picture 
had changed several dramatic ways see exhibit 
the share lng rose the most but coal and oil also 
gained some share for renewables the rise mind share 
was large but the rise energy share was modest only about 
perhaps the most impressive change was energy 
efficiency between and real gdp rose 
while total energy use fell short the most dramatic 
response the fukushima accidents came the

transitions japan very large energy transitions can 
happen relatively short periods time non price factors 
such diversification and pollution are crucial energy

choice best mix starts with the technology menu 
this example there are two energy technologies available 
extractive and renewable the extractive resources are 
cheap unit energy produced but dirty units 
pollution per unit energy contrast the renewable 
resources are expensive unit energy produced but 
clean only units pollution per unit energy say the 
economy needs units energy all were provided the

these possible energy mixes are shown exhibit the 
relationship between cost and pollution downward sloping 
line the share extractives falls 
pollution falls but costs rise these are the economic 
implications different energy mixes all for given level 
total energy use 
the economy needed more total energy the tradeoff line would shift outward 
and parallel the original line the economy needed less total energy the 
tradeoff line would shift inward and parallel the original line the slope 
the line determined the costs and pollutions levels the technology and 
independent the total amount energy used change the total amount 
energy used would shift the position the line but not the slope 
however technology changes over time sometimes through 
private and sometimes through public sector efforts indeed 
renewable technologies have become much cheaper recent 
years factor behind the expansion renewable energy 
moreover perceived costs can also change based 
experience with technology for example until march 
even the left wing favored major expansion nuclear power 
japan after the fukushima accidents the perceived costs 
nuclear power rose along with reassessment likely 
pollution levels meanwhile the cost solar panels plummeted 
and their efficiency rose 
what happens energy mix choices when technology 
changes exhibit illustrates renewables technology 
becomes cheaper then the slope the tradeoff line 
changes any non zero level renewables use the same 
amount energy use units implies energy menu 
with both lower costs and lower pollution short the impact

society willing reduce pollution only the incremental cost 
doing very low the equilibrium point point where 
the social tradeoff between cost and pollution exactly the 
same the technological tradeoff the case illustrated 
society prefers low cost low pollution thus the share 
extractives very high 
however social choices need not favor low costs indeed over 
recent decades tighter pollution controls have been introduced 
precisely because social preferences have changed exhibit 
illustrates what happens when preferences shift toward low 
pollution the point where social tradeoff equals the 
technology tradeoff shifts from point point that the 
best mix shifts away from high share extractives high 
share renewables 
exhibit 
the best mix changes when social preferences 
shift toward low pollution 
social choice preferences imply different energy mixes

low cost preference 
low pollution preference 
social choice shifts low

extractives near

which point the energy menu choose 
while specifying the technology tradeoff relatively easy 
choosing point not society must decide about tradeoffs 
there will combinations cost and pollution which 
society will indifferent economics jargon indifference 
curves the key point about these combinations that they 
show diminishing marginal returns everyone prefers lower 
pollution the question how much extra cost society willing 
bear order achieve incremental cut pollution 
moreover pollution goes down the willingness society 
bear extra costs recedes

the policy conclusion order make shift toward 
electricity result lower pollution need make the term 
negative that one must improve electricity conversion 
efficiency reduce and reduce the share 
electricity produced extractives these actions must 
large enough take the product the two components below 
the product fuel conversion efficiency and the share 
extractives fuel production and respectively since 
already low and already high the focus should 
and 
note that rise electricity use need not raise extractive use 
there efficiency gain the final use electricity for 
example shift toward electric cars would increase extractive 
use mileage electric cars were the same that gasoline 
cars however electric cars have very high final efficiency 
even official estimation methods for electric vehicles are 
generous for example the nissan leaf has city gas 
mileage mpg equivalent while the similar nissan versa 
note gets 
see http nissanusa which lists specitfications for vehicles our 
calculations suggest that long the mpg electric car exceeds about 
the mpg its counterpart the electric car would produce less this 
true because the better mileage the electric car would offset the low efficiency 
fossil fuel conversion into electricity 
finally there remains the question how the market shares 
and change over time the answer that they react 
prices and costs since japan price taker the japan 
model above prices are exogenous moreover technology 
also exogenous least for this model hence 
reasonable the japan model see the market shares too 
exogenous 
for global model however this would not true prices 
are endogenous once prices become endogenous then 
supply side for energy must also specified that prices are 
determined within the model one way this use 
logistic curves based price ratios such method makes 
the coefficients inside the matrices the model 
endogenous the model then becomes highly nonlinear and 
highly interactive herculean task find analytical 
solution such model 
such case better base market shares 
previous period prices which quite reasonable light 
adjustment lags the energy sector then the results the 
model generate new prices which are help determine the 
market share coefficients the subsequent period short 
allowing time lags between pricing and market share changes 
transforms intractable non linear simultaneous system into 
set linear equations which easily solvable
