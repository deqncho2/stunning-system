sasol appears well placed benefit from our bullish view the refining cycle 
global oils team see material upside global refining margins see here 
with middle distillates the driving force key pillar this positive view the 
planned introduction new marine fuel standards imo see 
here which expected drive both middle distillate and crude demand higher 
but with negative implications for high sulphur fuel oil demand margins 
would expect sasol benefit absolute basis given the positive view for 
both crude and refining margins and relative basis exhibit reflects that 
sasol produces relatively high middle distillate their product slate 
global standards sasol mse weighted average global average yield 
south african coastal refineries not owned sasol likely more challenged 
the coastal refineries enref sapref chevref produce middle distillate yields 
the range and crucially relatively large fuel oil which 
often used for bunkering general view the south african coastal 
refineries less competitive global basis that they are generally smaller 
older and less complex than many the recent capacity additions sasol looks 
better positioned with the natref refinery designed upgrade heavy sour crude 
oil into high yield white products wood mackenzie reflects superior 
historical net cash margins natref than the coastal refineries 
raising numbers stronger zar oil price resulting increase our

source company data woodmac for all data other than sasol note yields are theoretical yields taken from woodmac and not necessarily 
represent actual production 
our global oil team have published notes global refining transition golden 
age may and crude oil countdown imo not plain sailing may 
which suggest that those refiners who can maximise middle distillate output while 
minimising fuel oil production are best placed benefit from the upcycle global 
refining margins additionally those with the deepest conversion capabilities the 
ability process heavy sour crude into the required products should benefit from 
discounted crude oil reducing input costs our view 
why the sasol slate relatively better positioned secunda the coal and gas based 
synthetic fuels manufacturing process produces slate 
gasoline diesel fuel oil respectively according sasol natref deep conversion 
refinery that designed upgrade heavy sour crude oil with high sulphur content 
and yields about white petroleum products natref location inland south africa 
has meant that from build there was always more limited market for fuel oil 
and hence the refinery was designed maximize white product natref produces 
slates gasoline jet fuel diesel fuel oil respectively oryx qatar 
the gas liquids technology produces high diesel the product slate 
general view south african coastal refineries sapref enref chevref not owned 
sasol less competitive measured global basis that they are generally 
smaller older and less complex than many the recent capacity additions china 
india and the middle east particular see exhibits and the refineries process 
crude slate that mostly medium api gravity and mixed terms sulphur 
content source wood mackenzie exhibit the refineries have historically processed 
crude oil originating largely from saudi arabia nigeria angola iran and the uae and this 
has historically resulted high delivery cost south africa the basic fuel price set 
import parity basis with reference mediterranean arab gulf and singapore 
product prices such the extent that south african refineries operate lower 
efficiencies than their global peers they may less competitive able maintain 
profitability 
the imo regulations could pose challenge for the coastal refineries our view 
these regulations will require the adoption lower sulphur standards for bunker fuels 
this expected result reduction demand for high sulphur fuel oil 
hsfo but increase middle distillate demand marine gasoil very low sulphur 
fuel oil blends post the south african coastal refiners produce high fraction 
fuel oil and major source demand for this fuel oil likely bunker fuel durban 
and richards bay harbours particular according the doe approximately 
south african liquid fuel production was fuel oil from sasol published 
numbers approximately its production black product implying that for the 
remainder the south african refineries fuel oil makes greater than the 
product slate refineries south africa are thus likely face challenge the 
disposal excess fuel oil they cannot supply low sulphur product offset 
these new regulations could also expected provide support refining margins 
received 
wood mackenzie provides benchmark net cash margin bbl see exhibit 
effectively refining margin received less refinery costs margins refinery 
refinery basis are not public and wood mackenzie uses its own methodology 
assumption set nevertheless provides useful benchmark and reflects the south 
african coastal refineries marginal over the period would highlight 
that implied bfp refining margins were weak and have subsequently recovered 
over the past decade south africa has become net importer liquid fuels exhibit 
and new retail players have entered the market without domestic refinery puma 
energy introducing additional competition the liquid fuels value chain sasol has 
historically had small geographic advantage given its inland location our view the 
introduction the transnet multi product pipeline scheduled for could however 
lower the cost transport from the coast into the inland market 
refineries are however viewed strategically important owning and operating 
refinery provides degree risk mitigation for the broader liquid fuels value chain all 
the south african refineries other than petrosa are integrated with downstream retail 
networks far provides security product supply from both refiner and 
national perspective and degree strategic optionality product mix balance for 
example the specs liquid fuels have meant that diesel imports have historically 
been more profitable than petrol imports and hence refineries have attempted 
maximise petrol productions locally this may shift should our view refining margins 
the middle distillate market play out the refinery also produces certain products 
lpg solvents bitumen fuel oil that are some extent difficult import and handle 
the potential clean fuels overhang remain unresolved june the south 
african government gazetted the clean fuels regulations align south african fuels 
with euro specifications the july introduction date has been postponed and 
new date awaited the extent which the economic cost implementation 
will could recovered through the basic fuel pricing mechanism has remained major
