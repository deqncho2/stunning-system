changing crude quality declining refinery investments 
demand shift towards middle distillates changing crude flows 
and geopolitics are reshaping the refining industry the recent 
margin correction presages why complex refiners will benefit 
amid the transition golden age 
equity analyst 
martijn rats morganstanley 
refining grms declined june gasoline and fuel oil spreads weakened 
this was largely owing higher refinery utilization and increased usage light 
grade crudes which led higher gasoline output they got cheaper led 
above normal runs refiners captured high product margins while processing 
cheaper crudes gasoline inventory built but interest complete contrast 
the decline middle distillate inventory across all major global oil trading 
hubs expect refining margins rise from current cash cost levels for simple 
refiners utilization rates decline normalized levels and product inventory 
gets digested steadily higher demand 
global utilization rates higher refining output ytd ytd 
rise utilization rates and startup vietnam refinery lower refinery outages 
and product exports from china were key supply growth which was 
tracking ytd line with estimates china majors showed 
rising utilization rates over the last few months nearly from but 
this was negated drop teapot output from overall product 
exports from china are ytd most other global refineries 
maintained high rates with global outages five year lows 
demand some weakness not trend higher oil prices and weather has led 
some slowdown demand growth for transport fuels few countries latin 
america and china recent data points show but demand growth the 
and india remains steady especially for transport fuels global demand growth 
for petroleum products averaging mbpd line with supply additions 
however with major capacity additions expect demand growth for 
refined products outpace supply 
crude premiums starting decline crude markets tightened the premiums 
benchmark middle eastern grade crudes rose for asian refiners our global 
commodities team expects crude prices rise view supply challenges but 
believe premiums crude will decline saudi arabia raises throughput 
fuel oil margins decline and refiners look alternatives replace opec grades 
have already seen signs declines crude grades like murban 
believe the recent pullback grms highlight the challenges from changing 
global crude supply 
yet believe they support our thesis golden age refining driven 
middle distillates complex refiners should benefit the expense less 
complex gasoline heavy refiners

who wins complexity back vogue over the past 
three years upcycle saw greater rise profitability 
for simple refiners than for complex refiners crude costs 
fell and product mix mattered less with improved fuel oil 
margins however believe complex refiners will drive the 
next leg the upcycle especially given the material 
upward shift quality crude output that visible 
globally refiners with the ability source heavy and 
super light crudes will have edge over their peers asia 
and the stand out this regard 
what priced refinery equities are mostly pricing 
margins remain below mid cycle levels after the 
correction the past month bbl asia 
however see upside risks grms utilization rates 
for simpler refiners decrease and refiners with high gasoline 
yields cut runs normalized levels this leads complex 
refiners with high distillate yields benefit materially
