sinopec earnings dividend cash flow balance sheet and valuation all look 
good while the stock has gained ytd the best performer among global 
energy names believe there more upside the company fundamentals 
look healthy from almost every perspective earnings growth under 
oil price assumption dividend yield likely reach even 
conservatively assuming payout fcf yield 
even after considering higher dividend and capex net cash per share 
and valuation and 
ebitda which more attractive than industry peers 
petrochina buy winter premium during summer after highlighting the winter 
premium and summer discount effect petrochina stock over the past two 
years believe the risk reward will favorable buy winter premium 
during the summer and sell summer discount during the winter higher crude 
oil price could also make petrochina fcf yield more attractive given the 
most sensitive ebitda movements among global energy peers 
cnooc performance driven largely oil price growth ahead 
and with stable all cost guidance for believe 
cnooc share performance will driven largely oil price movements given 
the lack company specific catalysts the company production profile 
flattish but believe growth will start and extend 
beyond exhibit however not expect investors asia have 
such long investment horizon therefore the growth premium unlikely 
reflected continue the stock given its large reserve potential 
domestic fields and the rising overseas growth opportunities trading 
and ebtida believe valuation attractive 
cosl earnings risk fully reflected with material loss believe the 
earnings risk has been fully reflected and thus close our non consensus call that 
cosl will have earnings miss well believe cosl earnings will 
recover qoq thanks cnooc rising exploration and development capex and 
earnings from more well services 
order preference petrochina higher oil price gas sinopec marketing ipo

gas summer discount has been mostly reflected 
for petrochina have previously flagged the risks associated with its summer gas 
discount including gas price decline during the slack season policy risk given the 
potential announcement national gas pipeline company and rising gas costs see 
our note china energy chemicals downgrade petrochina prefer sinopec 
petrochina and cnooc cosl jan believe most investors are aware 
these risk factors and that the downside risk limited 
would buy petrochina during the northern hemisphere summer for its winter 
premium and sell during the winter prepare for the summer discount 
petrochina stock performance has shown clear seasonal pattern recent years 
illustrated exhibit the stock has tended rally the winter due the price 
premium its gas business during the peak winter season and then rate during 
summer due the risk factors outlined earlier discussed more detail our report 
petrochina more realism about gas results and dividend good news

ebitda and fcf yield petrochina also looks attractive globally when compared 
against petrobras lukoil and rosneft

despite poor result are turning more positive cosl given believe the 
company likely achieve qoq recovery thanks cnooc rising 
exploration and development capex and increased earnings from well services according 
the company guidance 
addition our correlation analysis confirms the company high correlation with the 
crude oil price illustrated exhibit during the upcycle between and early 
cosl share price enjoyed upside compared with for brent and during 
the stable stage and the declining stage the share price 
moved line with brent since early brent has increased while cosl rose 
therefore the high historical correlation suggests that the brent price can rise 
further reaching bbl and cosl likely enjoy 
decent rating the back higher oil price although have lowered our 
earnings forecast reflect slower than expected earnings recovery lift our price
