global refining 
transition golden age 
nderinvestment refining slippages capacity adds and overdone 
concerns long term demand set the stage for the refining upcycle 
inflect into golden age until see rise refinery margins 
with complex refiners being outsized winners and offering equity upside 
the long payback cycle competition from renewables evs and 
near doubling upfront investment has nearly halved refining 
investment below midcycle levels despite three year upcycle 
with jet fuel mining chemicals and heavy transport demand here 
stay the world falling short about one refinery annually until 
think the dilemma strong near term demand and 
longer term competition from alternative non fossil fuels will not 
only cap supply but propel margins steadily higher into what see 
golden age for refining the cost upgrade old hardware 
meet new environmental norms prohibitive and crowding out 
existing high cost refiners combination the above should consolidate the market and keep refining margins higher for longer 
supply grow not grow globally have experienced 
higher growth petroleum product demand the past three 
years than the past decade normal cycle this would have triggered announcements significant growth investment however 
demand concerns amid competition from alternative energy sources 
and the rise cash breakeven cycle years for new investment 
have put refiners dilemma which has seen new investment intensity halve and turn put cap supply hence while the world 
needs three refineries every year match demand growth will fall 
short one each year our estimates 
demand fueling ahead see significant upside potential 
logistics shipping chemicals aviation and mining sector demand 
middle distillate fuels remain the core these operations and 
hence our view that diesel demand growth and margins will nearly 
double emerging markets have seen upturn 
demand this year india latam and the middle east are key this 
growth with above trend gdp overall estimate 
above the year average petroleum product demand growth with 
contributing the growth until 
while gasoline drove the refining cycle into its silver age believe 
diesel will spearhead the transition into golden age its margins
