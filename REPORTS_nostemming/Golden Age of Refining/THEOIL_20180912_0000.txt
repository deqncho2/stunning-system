imo sulfur regulation tailwind for the global 
refining industry yet for the remaining not

our views from may the upcoming imo sulfur regulation imo 
introduces one the largest dislocations the oil product market may 
set out our expectations higher middle distillate cracks lower high sulfur fuel oil 
cracks and stronger refinery crude runs altogether these are tailwinds for the 
refiners and support further oil market tightness 
four factors have evolved and adjust forecasts accordingly scrubber orders 
have tracked slightly ahead our expectations and coal and lng prices have 
rallied strongly result see higher floor for hsfo prices the same 
time emerging market currencies have weakened lowering the ceiling for middle 
distillate prices also see more read across gasoline than before have 
adjusted our product price forecasts accordingly although slightly different the 
broad trends remain the same 
our new estimates refiners are set benefit but are not 
have applied our new price forecast last year output refineries 
collectively these account for global refining capacity unsurprisingly 
refiners benefit more from higher distillate cracks than from lower hsfo 
cracks and hence see margin uplift however the opposite true for the 
remaining mostly simple capacity for which imo headwind 
around refining capacity could see negative margins putting 
output risk for capacity margin could deteriorate negative 
levels globally utilisation refineries with positive margins percentage 
points higher than those with negative margins refiners don stop processing 
crude when margins turn negative but some run cuts are likely 
this creates further opportunities for complex refiners which would need 
run harder imo concentrates more oil demand narrower part the 
barrel the short run this will require higher crude runs make the desired 
products before refiners upgrade and optimize already see crude runs 
increasing above the rate refinery capacity expansion there are run 
cuts simple refiners that suffer from imo that would mean even more 
demanded from complex refiners who are already set benefit 
reiterate key views positive for refiners and oil prices spot oil prices 
gasoils crack spreads and time spreads well the brent dubai spread should 
benefit from imo top imo positive for the listed refining 
sector selected equities marathon and valero the reliance thai oil and 
bpcl asia and repsol and saras europe all rated overweight

the dark side imo 
imo remains major dislocation our views from may 
starting jan new regulation from the international maritime organisation imo 
will sharply lower the maximum sulfur emission global shipping whilst this industry 
accounts for just global oil demand this nevertheless introduces one the 
largest dislocations the oil products market recent decades 
two reports may set out our expectations how this would impact global oil 
markets the coming scramble for middle distillates and countdown imo not 
plain sailing short expect that significant part the shipping industry will meet 
the new regulations switching compliant fuels orders for scrubbers another 
way complying have accelerated recent months but they remain insufficient 
especially the short term result demand for marine gasoil middle distillate 
will increase sharply around early which will come the expense demand for 
high sulfur fuel oil least for while this will drive middle distillate cracks spreads 
higher but put pressure hsfo cracks spreads 
refiners will likely shift their yields away from hsfo towards middle distillates much 
possible however there are limitations the speed and the extent which this can 
done the short term therefore satisfy middle distillate demand argued 
that least for while the global refining system simply needs process more crude 
oil this supported our view tighter oil markets and further oil price strength which 
reiterate here 
our may reports attached set crude and product price forecasts this 
outlook see exhibit below imo does not have phased introduction takes 
effect abruptly single day these forecasts focused the period shortly after 
jan over time shippers and refiners have lot scope adapt install more 
scrubbers build additional cokers direct crude flow etc however the short term 
there likely some stress within the system 
argued that middle distillate prices would need rise levels where some demand 
destruction takes place which estimated would happen per metric tonne 
also saw hsfo prices fall levels where would start displace other fuels 
power generation such coal and lng this basis expected that hsfo could 
fall little tonne 
these forecasts are summarized exhibit since then number factors have 
continued evolve leading adjust these forecasts the basis for setting various 
forecasts unchanged and the broad trends remain place discuss these changes

now assume that scrubbers will installed early which would

increase and beyond but upside for limited our view given the limited 
amount time available 
higher coal and lng prices lifting hsfo floor given the surplus hsfo 
expect that its price will need decline level where becomes competitive with 
coal and lng power generation therefore our forecast for hsfo for based 
the heat equivalent price these commodities may estimated this 
however this now looks too pessimistic since may prices coal and lng have 
increased and respectively this has also lifted floor price for hsfo 
our view which now estimate tonne 
weaker currencies lowering the gasoil ceiling given the potential for middle 
distillate demand argue that prices will need rise level where some 
demand destruction will take place may pegged this per metric tonne

vgo diversion window opens repricing gasoline too one method which 
refiners can meet rising demand for bunker fuel through the use vacuum gasoil 
vgo this produced vacuum distillation units vdus and usually used 
feedstock for fluid catalytic crackers fccs mostly make gasoline however lowsulfur vgo can also used blend directly into imo compliant bunker fuel 
diverting vgo away from fccs and into the bunker pool effectively connects gasoline 
and middle distillate pricing result imo will likely result pricing all 
clean products exhibit show simplified economics fcc current prices 
our price forecast for distillate probably high enough start drawing vgo away 
from fccs prevent this from happening and keep fcc economic least profitable 
gasoline prices would need increase too from our old forecast

and taking some pressure off crude runs although these still need accelerate 
using vgo bunker fuel could relieve some pressure distillate and hence moderate 
the need for refineries increase crude runs still this only modest effect still 
suspect that global crude runs will need accelerate significantly due imo 
over the last six years trend growth demand for middle distillate and gasoline 
combined has been running see exhibit our economics teams not 
forecast sharp economic slowdown starting point assume this will broadly 
continue this trend rate combined gasoline and distillate demand would increase 
over the period with our higher scrubber forecast estimate that imo 
will add this via increased demand for marine gasoil down from 
previously still this suggests total demand growth these products 
exhibit shows the global relationship between crude oil processed and gasoline plus 
middle distillate produced over the last decade the global refining system has 
managed increase gasoline and distillate output barrels for every barrel 
additional crude produced the reason this ratio above lies the fact that the 
refining industry has been expanding upgrading capacity faster than utilisation capacity 
over the years refiners have installed more cokers crackers etc 
the short run this hard and would argue that the marginal gasoline plus 
diesel yield should not exceed yet even this stays intact refiners will still need 
increase crude runs during this about 
higher than would have been the case without imo also lower than our may 
estimate but significant increase nonetheless which will help tighten global oil 
markets

yet even our new forecasts imo has some negative impacts that 
have not discussed before the dark side imo 
although some our estimates have changed our main forecasts are unaltered imo 
still set lead higher refinery crude runs boosting refinery utilisation and 
margins and middle distillate cracks particular may argued this was positive for 
the refining sector call that reiterate 
still that was not complete conclusion provide more granularity have 
simulated the impact the profitability the global refining system applying our 
price forecast last year output refineries globally product 
product total this set refineries accounts for crude processing capacity 
out worldwide total 
the implicit assumption this analysis that the product mix still broadly 
indicative output inevitably refiners will try shift towards middle distillate 
however this effect very difficult model and its impact profitability likely 
modest most refineries are optimised for specific crude diet and work within 
relatively narrow operating conditions although this simplification this analysis has 
highlighted some key conclusions 
expected imo beneficial for global refining capacity our price 
forecasts refining capacity would substantially more profitable than 
average gross margins would increase several dollars per barrel 
yet the opposite true for the remaining simple refiners suffer more from the 
decline hsfo cracks than they benefit from the rise middle distillate cracks 
average expect their gross margins deteriorate sharply 
additional capacity would driven into negative margins forward 
curves show higher hsfo cracks and lower middle distillate cracks than forecast 
still even those prices additional refining capacity would yield 
negative gross margins our price forecasts this would increase

still negative margins could lead run cuts product output risk 
refiners that are faced with negative margins not necessarily stop processing crude 
however slowdown refinery crude runs still likely how much hard 
quantify however refiners with positive gross margins operated utilisation rate 
last year whilst those with negative margins ran this percentage point 
spread indicative the refining capacity that could see its gross margin 
negative could reduce runs 
which could middle distillate these refiners are the relatively simply 
ones and thus have high hsfo yields and modest middle distillate yields our 
calculation the average middle distillate yields refiners that could see their gross 
margins negative hence reduction crude runs would reduce 
middle distillate output 
this creates further opportunities for already profitable refineries exacerbating the 
tailwind refinery utilisation was already high however this included 
countries like venezuela and mexico where crude runs are held other factors 
swing regions where utilisation can respond economic incentives utilisation was 
already this includes all the oecd where refinery utilisation increased further 
reaching may 
yet crude runs will need increase further during estimated 
above partly because imo over that period refining capacity will expand 
our estimates this imbalance will boost refinery utilisation further top 
that simple refineries cut some runs complex refineries will need run even harder 
incentivise them refining margins will need stay higher for longer

already may argued that the imo regulation was positive for the listed refining 
sector overwhelmingly refiners under coverage are more exposed the tailwind 
higher middle distillate cracks than the headwind falling hsfo cracks also the need 
for higher crude runs will further increase refinery utilisation which usually requires 
higher refining margins too the risk run cuts from the the global refining 
system that stands suffer from imo only exacerbates this effect for the 
beneficiaries highlight several refining equities that rate overweight marathon 
and valero the reliance thai oil and bpcl asia and repsol and saras 
europe 
yet there are weaker players too lower hsfo cracks due imo and lack 
investment respond this could challenge margins for simple refiners particularly 
asia like esso thailand exxon subsidiary and star petroleum chevron 
subsidiary both have lower flexibility crude sourcing and not have hardware 
upgrade products expect that both will negatively hit imo 
decline fuel oil margins would impact earnings negatively for
