forward aside from the company paid one time special dividends following the

where could wrong 
our positive view the refining industry may not pan out due the following factors 
supply demand dynamics rising oil prices lead higher demand destruction 
effectively making supply demand dynamics less tight than initially thought 
particular faltering middle distillate demand from weakened macro conditions for 
power generation sluggish emerging market auto sales and lackluster passenger traffic 
growth for air travel could derail our positive thesis for oil margins 
crude premiums sourcing flexibility strong refining margins may trigger rising crude 
premiums osp oil producers shift some the costs refiners particular 
note that oil has limited flexibility versus peers for crude sourcing and this could 
ongoing concern while the company lacks the ability source different crude from 
different producers oil imports come from saudi arabia believe some risks 
can mitigated the company optimizes blending configurations shifts away from 
medium grades for more heavier grades that should command more discount going 
forward blend with lighter grade oil 
capex dividend risks line with other domestic peers caltex hyundai oilbank 
oil may make unexpected announcement for additional capex requirements 
expand its product portfolio naphtha cracker expansion this may dampen 
sentiment related increasing dividend payments
