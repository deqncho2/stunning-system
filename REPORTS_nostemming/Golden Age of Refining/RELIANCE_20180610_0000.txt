ril stock has been range bound ytd but see the stars 
aligning for break toward our diesel polyester and 
retail margins step new normal telecom subscriber 
growth sets new benchmarks and capex unwinds this should 
energise front loaded ebitda rise years 
ril profitability appears transitioning new normal all businesses 
are experiencing once decade step ups margins usually seen with 
such transitions there has been investor skepticism and some earnings volatility 
the past three quarters and hence the stock has been range bound however think the stage set for earnings inflection with upside 
triggers every quarter until end see exhibit driving upside surprise 
consensus earnings 
what could drive breakout once the market appreciates 
breakout energy margins being the new normal and sustainable telecom 
subscriber adds remaining high broadband business clarity rising retail 
remaining hyper growth path and capex showing increasing signs 
slowing see earnings cagr for the next three years 
refining diesel imo and complexity are the three key ingredients for 
potential rise refining margins additional cash 
flows our view view ril among the best positioned global refiners 
benefit from what expect doubling diesel margins ytd 
and imo implementation has diesel output benefits from 
cheaper light and heavy crudes and has zero fuel oil output 
chemicals gas feedstock polyester and volume growth should catalyse stepup margins polyester margins are ytd see exhibit gas oil 
differentials have widened favour ril and all chemical expansion 
projects are fully ramped benefitting from the upcycle spreads that 
believe will new normal until this should raise petrochemical 
profitability and base investor expectations upward

significant investor skepticism about our estimates for ril

lower debt may lower roe and ril recent history has 
not paid very high dividend payout put things 
perspective estimate ril will generate average 
annual cash flow from operations over the 
next three years and annualised average 
investments with telecom energy and 
retail however telecom and retail capex were 
higher than estimates and similar levels 
could see downside risk one year forward nav 
capex seen declining after investments 
this has been key investor question and see some 
anecdotal evidence capex intensity falling energy 
capex appears largely behind petcoke gasifiers have 
started operations and telecom capex total 
mobility mostly done with focus rolling 
broadband wireline services starting this quarter ril capex 
declined and expect decline 
while the market has been concerned about capex 
overshoot see limited risks our estimates considering 
most energy capex behind and wireless coverage 
targeted the company reach end 
retail hyper growth mode expect earnings 
double two years after more than doubling ril 
retail business should see upside risks margins from both 
new store openings and retail pump station expansion 
source company data morgan stanley research estimates 
valuation suggests upside potential 
ril has gone through three cycles return expansion and 
declines with simultaneous fcf growth and compression 
cycles interest most these cycles the stock has 
outperformed peers during times return expansion and

precedence over earnings growth with regard stock 
outperformance during cycles large capex and declining 
returns the stock has underperformed regional peers and 
the market believe this highlights the relative 
underweight investor positioning ril

that despite the large cash flow generation from the core energy business ril could 
announce further fresh capex and hence might not generate any free cash our view 
that ril likely take pause stabilizing its recent downstream expansion well
