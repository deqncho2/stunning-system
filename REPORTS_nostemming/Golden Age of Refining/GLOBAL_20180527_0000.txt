key research notes 
global refining transition golden age may 
crude oil countdown imo not plain sailing may 
crude oil the coming scramble for middle distillates raising oil price 
forecast may 
isn higher oil price negative for refining this was the most common 
question globally from clients 
our view while higher oil has negative impact demand operating costs and 
working capital dig into the details the above reasons should actually drive 
marginal cash cost higher and raise margins the refining markets tighten 
demand accounts for global demand growth and investor concerns 
have risen due higher oil and weakening local currencies interestingly 
consumers have not seen material benefits from the oil price correction the 
past three years due higher taxes and hence oil price rise also being 
cushioned tax cuts markets such india brazil thailand are lowering 
fuel taxes after raising them when the oil price was lower some countries such 
like indonesia and malaysia have capped fuel prices ytd demand has 
risen with middle distillate demand rising addition mining activity and 
oil rigs the have supported demand growth continued below

why are supply additions still slow despite three years good margins 
tectonic shift underway how new capital investments refining are being 
thought about even good margins past three years have not been able 
attract major investments concerns competition from alternative fuels 
believe this divergence from earlier cycles primes the refinery industry for the 
golden age twenty mega refiners will needed fulfill demand the time 
takes build one refinery while supply may feel like lot actually see 
falling short demand growth see exhibit 
won teapots spoil the golden age while see china refining exports 
rising believe regional players that have much lower opex will continue 
benefit global marginal cash cost rises with oil higher oil price 
environment believe refiners with scale and complexity will benefit the most 
see exh the note 
will electrification rate refining multiples see limited impact 
refining from evs the medium term estimate global refined product 
demand will grow until this despite our estimate 
reduction internal combustion engine ice market share total car sales 
even the developed markets japan and europe refining 
multiples have remained relatively stable despite decline domestic 
petroleum product demand but high cost capacity closures have occurred 
hence evs were drive decline demand growth gasoline diesel 
believe less efficient capacity would affected and those companies asia 
that are the lower end the cash cost curve would benefit 
diesel demand how confident are and just about imo estimate 
diesel the driving force behind higher refinery margins global demand 
for oil metals air travel and logistics coupled with imo regulations should 
contribute the increase middle distillate demand until which 
estimate will grow more than supply growth 
transition golden age refining 
exhibit what makes bullish 
world need three new refineries year but adding only two 
demand growth sustain from airlines logistics chemicals and mining
