refining upside indian refiners have middle distillate yields with 
coking capacity and also have some the best hardware which should see them 
benefit from higher diesel demand and higher light oil supply with diesel 
margins expected double this should lead reliance omcs refining 
margins rise average and lead cagr earnings 
growth for refiners india euro transition will also support 
rise margins for refiners estimate indian refiners also have clear 
plans lower fuel oil output mid 
home ground benefit demand grows estimate india will account for 
nearly quarter global fuel demand growth new highways 
airports raise travel lead middle distillate demand and chemical demand rises 
this should drive cagr growth demand and support margin expansion 
while there could some near term marketing margin volatility due 
upcoming state elections the stocks are pricing near zero nav for their 
marketing businesses similar our bear case and hence limiting downside risk 
will higher oil spoil the refining party even bbl oil environment 
believe the rise operating costs will cushioned rising distillate 
margins the tightening refining cycle should raise marginal cash costs the 
industry and support margins for cost efficient indian refiners lower gas prices 
will lower opex inflation compared past cycles 
what not priced the market pricing decline refining margins due 
higher oil prices but not the upside from higher middle distillate margins until 
this should drive upside surprise for consensus estimates over two 
years key catalysts include demand growth and rise domestic fuel prices 
what changed raise indian refiners earnings for and 
incorporate our more bullish view the global refining margins reliance which 
one our top pick three picks globally benefits the most from its complex 
refinery configuration and higher oil price assumptions for omcs our pts offer 
upside largely unchanged lower for hpcl lower the

refining remains driver seat 
believe indian refiners standout the key beneficiaries 
the rising global demand for diesel considering their high 
middle distillate product exposure and countercyclical 
investments which should bear fruit during this upcycle 
indian oil demand also offers one largest oil gas 
growth opportunities our view and with refiners having 
invested past five years countercyclically 
these investments should start bearing fruit with our 
positive view diesel margins and indian refiners having 
one the highest exposures globally middle distillates

indian oil refiners have seen refining margins rise from

step margins has come despite flattish benchmark 
margins ytd and driving the debate sustainability 
refining margins 
bpcl 
believe the rise middle distillate margins yet not 
factored into consensus estimates and the market 
ignoring the upside risks from tightening global demand 
supply for refining however the stocks are pricing the rise 
operating costs from the rise crude oil prices hence 
see close upside surprise for consensus estimates 
the omcs stocks offer sustainable dividend

making valuations attractive 
hpcl

morgan stanley research estimates 
believe product yield upgrades higher diesel margins 
and crude discounts will continue keep driving margins 
higher towards bbl while part the 
improved margins also came from lower crude oil costs 
which are now reversing think this will more than 
offset gains from refinery expansion and upgradation 
why middle distillates will better see middle 
distillate supply limited due the following reasons 
middle distillate cracks have provided incentive 
optimise middle distillate yields for some time the main 
source supply growth shale increasingly light and 
tends have higher gasoline and naphtha yield but 
produce fewer middle distillates and with most complex 
refiners already running near maximum utilisation any 
incremental refining capacity less complex and likely 
have lower middle distillate yield 
exhibit india middle distillate yields are among the highest 
globally 
more importantly highlight that indian refiners have the 
highest exposure diesel which their refining 
product slate implying their refining margins can
