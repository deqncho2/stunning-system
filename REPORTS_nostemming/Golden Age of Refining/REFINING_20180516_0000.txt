refining marketing 
raising our refining marketing view attractive from line see the 
current refining cycle going higher and further with gross margins expanding 
through robust product demand growth mmbpd should 
driven inflecting emerging market consumption primarily india latam and 
the middle east and approaching imo fuel regulation changes that concentrate 
demand middle distillates see our global refining insight report transition 
golden age here and our note changing shipping fuel regulation 
countdown imo not plain sailing here 
global refiners have long runway benefit from combination limited 
supply from decade long capital discipline and rising demand refining capex 
peaked and has been trending down with restraint investment and 
concerns long term demand uncertainty given the emergence alternative 
fuels and the increasing hype around electric vehicles such expect supply 
struggle keep with demand global refining capacity additions are 
limited mmbpd until consensus mmbpd which will 
all likelihood face start slippages cost overruns and overly ambitious 
timelines the simplest terms believe the world needs three refineries 
every year match demand growth and will fall short one refinery each 
year through our estimates 
refiners are experiencing incremental regional tailwinds with structurally 
low natural gas prices north america and growing canadian and oil output 
refiners enjoy the benefit sitting top abundantly cheap natural gas 
and crude oil feedstock the reemergence crude price differentials north 
america will materially enhance margin capture for refineries our view 
believe this cost advantage will allow refiners gain market share the 
group export capacity grows finally the current administration seeking 
reverse regulations that have arguably been moderating demand growth any 
reduction the constraining effects programs like the renewable fuel 
standard also known rfs where mandated ethanol volumes displace 
gasoline and create compliance costs for refiners and ultimately 
consumers the fuel efficiency standards cafe etc could provide 
short medium term boost transport fuel demand the 
despite performance valuation remains attractive given our robust outlook

while refiners have rallied over the past months and have 
outperformed both the and broader energy believe 
valuation still looks attractive estimate the group trading midcycle ebitda compared the historical after adjusting for this year 
tax reform exhibit furthermore estimate refiners are trading 
average refining only multiple ebitda and ebitda 
compared the historical range exhibit exhibit 
history suggests there more room run the last major upcycle over global refiners posted total return compared the this cycle 
far specifically refining stocks generated return the last cycle compared 
the this cycle suggesting there still another leg higher absolute 
performance come exhibit note one potential counter argument that 
relative basis refiners have already outperformed the 
compared the last cycle however think the combination similar 
market tightness mbpd annual supply shortage being supplemented 
more attractive crude price differentials brent trades bbl 
premium wti discount and lower corporate taxes now 
warrant the stronger outperformance this time around 
upgrading vlo overweight raising price target believe vlo 
offers significant high quality exposure the current refining upcycle given the 
company the largest merchant refiner our coverage ebitda 
from refining peers its high quality operations low cost structure and 
growing exports should position well supply the robust global demand for 
products with this upgrade mpc and vlo are now our top pics within our 
refining coverage 
why not use some the smaller refiners play imo admit smaller 
refiners like pbf and hfc will provide more pure leverage imo and 
macro tailwinds however think the idiosyncratic factors for pbf like 
torrance reliability and the market outlook for padd adds incremental risk 
when trying play the sector trend hfc has already performed very well 
the back attractive north american crude price differentials and trades 
similar level vlo refining only basis further hfc landlocked 
the midcon preventing the company from having access the export market 
such prefer express our bullish refining view with names that offer high 
quality refining exposure with relatively less idiosyncratic risk growing access 
the export market and supplemented robust cash return program with 
upside
