smoother sailing with imo 
mandated shift low sulfur fuel for shippers will 
have second derivative impact lowering ptt gas cost 
inflation time when oil linked top line rising this drives 
margins record highs refining golden age adds 
annualized return until above street 
what does ptt have with imo regulations international maritime 
organization imo has mandated that all shippers move low sulfur fuels 
from the current high sulfur fuels while the surface there appears 
limited impact from this change ptt when combined with upstream 
concession extensions and the refinery golden age these regulations are likely 
affect the entire thailand energy value chain the second derivative impact 
much larger with potential lift returns above current consensus 
expectations unlike the conventional view expect the regulations benefit 
gas consumers ptt and even refiners top who actually produce high sulfur 
fuel oil hsfo and limit upside for upstream producers 
here the connection gas producer prices consumption thailand 
are linked high sulfur fuel oil prices hsfo demand falls with the decline 
shipping industry demand fuel oil prices will underperform brent oil and lower 
gas cost inflation ptt which net short for its gas requirements should 
benefit gas costs remain low and revenue linked brent oil prices rises 
estimate ptt gas division ebidta margins rise the last cycle peak 
with top quartile roce globally 
pttep upside capped production affected pttep gas producer 
prices has direct and indirect linkage with fuel oil price thus pttep may 
see domestic gas prices underperform oil similar although absolute 
realized prices would still rise well pttep oil output skewed 
toward condensate which could underperform brent oil prices given rising global 
supplies light and super light crudes however with rising reserve clarity and 
higher oil maintain 
refiners ptt group gain lot more than they lose lower demand for fuel oil 
also leads higher diesel demand and key pillar our view diesel 
margins doubling and refining industry transitioning the golden age with all 
ptt group refiners top pttgc and irpc having more diesel output 
than fuel oil refinery earnings should see cagr over with margins 
what priced while ptt pricing bbl oil and expects upside 
consensus eps are raising our earnings forecasts reflect 
bbl oil prices the impact imo and higher oil gas differentials 
however lower our target multiples factor higher bond yields and 
capital efficiency risks for ptt

ptt how does benefit from imo 
believe the upcoming imo regulation changes for the 
shipping industry and adoption euro norms will 
drive significant decline fuel oil demand and margins 
the changes will have indirect bearing ptt group 
which believe consensus underappreciating and hence 
expect higher total return for ptt than that factored 
current consensus estimates the changes present some 
headwinds for gas producers especially those like pttep 
with higher light oil supply and fuel oil linked gas pricing 
with pttep having both believe the market will 
surprised see higher oil not fully translating into earnings 
leverage however higher oil prices and potential contract 
extensions will continue drive returns and earnings 
higher this should benefit integrated oil companies like 
ptt margins expand with higher oil gas differentials

what are imo regulations imo addresses key 
issue sulphur emissions the shipping industry accounts 
for just global oil demand but responsible for 
all oil based sulfur emissions for context the 
sulphur emissions one cruise liner are the same

how does ptt benefit 
about ptt earnings pttep are exposed 
imo regulation changes through its gas sales industrial 
and chemical segments well via its refinery associates 
ptt gas business affected two ways gas sales 
industrial customers are also linked fuel oil and 
profitability the gsp chemical business will 
recalibrated gas costs underperform oil 
source pttep 
from gas sales industrial customers total sale 
volumes ptt can vary its discounts fuel oil change 
linkage oil linked pricing per market dynamics also 
considering these are more dynamic contracts with annual 
resets most consumers may not even seen any significant 
cost inflation however about ptt industrial 
gas sales are its associate refineries and hence top 
pttgc and irpc may switch using fuel oil they are not 
able find customers economically for fuel oil 
about ptt gas sales volumes are sold 
chemical industry with chemical linked pricing with 
chemical prices expected rise with oil from think 
ptt would benefit from lower gas costs and higher oil pricelinked revenues estimate ptt gas business margins 
rise fuel oil crude margins decline 
toward the levels seen and fall 
another 
refiners how they benefit estimate diesel 
the driving force behind higher refinery margins global 
demand for oil metals air travel and logistics coupled with 
imo regulations should contribute the increase 
middle distillate demand until which estimate will 
grow that supply growth estimate diesel 
margins double from levels and with 
ptt refinery throughput middle distillates 
should benefit overall ptt refineries throughput 
fuel oil but half that converted lubes ptt net 
exposure fuel oil limited with irpc upgrading its 
refinery and top planning upgrade see 
limited risks from imo regulations for ptt group refining 
business see details the note 
ptt best way play upside from upstream contract 
extensions ptt net short its gas 
requirements benefits from supply cheap domestic gas 
and security feedstock from pttgc for its ethane 
requirements helped the extension licences for two 
fields bangkot and erawan supply nearly ptt 
needs the capped gas pricing formulae per the bidding

cost inflation and supports cheaper availability feedstock
